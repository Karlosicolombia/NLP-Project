

I've,developed,a,new,open,source,P2P,e-cash,system,called,Bitcoin.,It's,completely,decentralized,,with,no,central,server,or,trusted,parties,,because,everything,is,based,on,crypto,proof,instead,of,trust.,Give,it,a,try,,or,take,a,look,at,the,screenshots,and,design,paper:

Download,Bitcoin,v0.1,at,http://www.bitcoin.org

The,root,problem,with,conventional,currency,is,all,the,trust,that's,required,to,make,it,work.,The,central,bank,must,be,trusted,not,to,debase,the,currency,,but,the,history,of,fiat,currencies,is,full,of,breaches,of,that,trust.,Banks,must,be,trusted,to,hold,our,money,and,transfer,it,electronically,,but,they,lend,it,out,in,waves,of,credit,bubbles,with,barely,a,fraction,in,reserve.,We,have,to,trust,them,with,our,privacy,,trust,them,not,to,let,identity,thieves,drain,our,accounts.,Their,massive,overhead,costs,make,micropayments,impossible.

A,generation,ago,,multi-user,time-sharing,computer,systems,had,a,similar,problem.,Before,strong,encryption,,users,had,to,rely,on,password,protection,to,secure,their,files,,placing,trust,in,the,system,administrator,to,keep,their,information,private.,Privacy,could,always,be,overridden,by,the,admin,based,on,his,judgment,call,weighing,the,principle,of,privacy,against,other,concerns,,or,at,the,behest,of,his,superiors.,Then,strong,encryption,became,available,to,the,masses,,and,trust,was,no,longer,required.,Data,could,be,secured,in,a,way,that,was,physically,impossible,for,others,to,access,,no,matter,for,what,reason,,no,matter,how,good,the,excuse,,no,matter,what.

It's,time,we,had,the,same,thing,for,money.,With,e-currency,based,on,cryptographic,proof,,without,the,need,to,trust,a,third,party,middleman,,money,can,be,secure,and,transactions,effortless.

One,of,the,fundamental,building,blocks,for,such,a,system,is,digital,signatures.,A,digital,coin,contains,the,public,key,of,its,owner.,To,transfer,it,,the,owner,signs,the,coin,together,with,the,public,key,of,the,next,owner.,Anyone,can,check,the,signatures,to,verify,the,chain,of,ownership.,It,works,well,to,secure,ownership,,but,leaves,one,big,problem,unsolved:,double-spending.,Any,owner,could,try,to,re-spend,an,already,spent,coin,by,signing,it,again,to,another,owner.,The,usual,solution,is,for,a,trusted,company,with,a,central,database,to,check,for,double-spending,,but,that,just,gets,back,to,the,trust,model.,In,its,central,position,,the,company,can,override,the,users,,and,the,fees,needed,to,support,the,company,make,micropayments,impractical.

Bitcoin's,solution,is,to,use,a,peer-to-peer,network,to,check,for,double-spending.,In,a,nutshell,,the,network,works,like,a,distributed,timestamp,server,,stamping,the,first,transaction,to,spend,a,coin.,It,takes,advantage,of,the,nature,of,information,being,easy,to,spread,but,hard,to,stifle.,For,details,on,how,it,works,,see,the,design,paper,at,http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

The,result,is,a,distributed,system,with,no,single,point,of,failure.,Users,hold,the,crypto,keys,to,their,own,money,and,transact,directly,with,each,other,,with,the,help,of,the,P2P,network,to,check,for,double-spending.

Welcome,to,the,new,Bitcoin,forum!

The,old,forum,can,still,be,reached,here:
http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/boards/index.php

I'll,repost,some,selected,threads,here,and,add,updated,answers,to,questions,where,I,can.

Bitcoins,are,sent,to,and,from,bitcoin,addresses,,which,are,essentially,random,numbers,with,no,identifying,information.

When,you,send,to,an,IP,address,,the,transaction,is,still,written,to,a,bitcoin,address.,The,IP,address,is,only,used,to,connect,to,the,recipient's,computer,to,request,a,fresh,bitcoin,address,,give,the,transaction,directly,to,the,recipient,and,get,a,confirmation.

Blocks,contain,a,history,of,the,bitcoin,addresses,that,a,coin,has,been,transferred,to.,If,the,identities,of,the,people,using,the,bitcoin,addresses,are,not,known,and,each,address,is,used,only,once,,then,this,information,only,reveals,that,some,unknown,person,transferred,some,amount,to,someone,else.

The,possibility,to,be,anonymous,or,pseudonymous,relies,on,you,not,revealing,any,identifying,information,about,yourself,in,connection,with,the,bitcoin,addresses,you,use.,If,you,post,your,bitcoin,address,on,the,web,,then,you're,associating,that,address,and,any,transactions,with,it,with,the,name,you,posted,under.,If,you,posted,under,a,handle,that,you,haven't,associated,with,your,real,identity,,then,you're,still,pseudonymous.

For,greater,privacy,,it's,best,to,use,bitcoin,addresses,only,once.,You,can,change,addresses,as,often,as,you,want,using,Options->Change,Your,Address.,Transfers,by,IP,address,automatically,use,a,new,bitcoin,address,each,time.

>,Can,nodes,tell,which,bitcoin,addresses,belong,to,which,IP,addresses?

No.

>,Is,there,a,command,line,option,to,enable,the,sock,proxy,the,first
>,time,that,bitcoin,starts?

In,the,next,release,(version,0.2),,the,command,line,to,run,it,through,a,proxy,from,the,first,time,is:
bitcoin,-proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

The,problem,for,TOR,is,that,the,IRC,server,which,Bitcoin,uses,to,initially,discover,other,nodes,bans,the,TOR,exit,nodes,,as,all,IRC,servers,do.,If,you've,already,connected,once,before,then,you're,already,seeded,,but,for,the,first,time,,you'd,need,to,provide,the,address,of,a,node,as,such:
bitcoin,-proxy=127.0.0.1:9050,-addnode=<someipaddress>

If,someone,running,a,node,with,a,static,IP,address,that,can,accept,incoming,connections,could,post,their,IP,to,use,for,-addnode,,that,would,be,great.

>,What,happens,if,you,send,bitcoins,to,an,IP,address,that,has,multiple
>,clients,connected,through,network,address,translation,(NAT)?

Whichever,one,you've,set,your,NAT,to,forward,port,8333,to,will,receive,it.,If,your,router,can,change,the,port,number,when,it,forwards,,you,could,allow,more,than,one,client,to,receive.,For,instance,,if,port,8334,forwards,to,a,computer's,port,8333,,then,senders,could,send,to,"x.x.x.x:8334"

If,your,NAT,can't,translate,port,numbers,,there,currently,isn't,a,command,line,option,to,change,the,incoming,port,that,bitcoin,binds,to,,but,I'll,look,into,it.

We've,been,working,hard,on,improvements,for,the,next,version,release.,Martti,(sirius-m),added,some,nice,features,to,make,it,more,user,friendly,and,easier,to,run,in,the,background:
,-,Minimize,to,system,tray,option
,-,Autostart,on,boot,option,so,you,can,keep,it,running,in,the,background,automatically
,-,New,options,dialog,layout
,-,Setup,EXE,for,Windows,,in,addition,to,the,archive,download

I've,been,working,on,a,number,of,refinements,to,the,networking,code,and,laying,the,groundwork,for,future,functionality.,Also,coming,in,version,0.2:
,-,Multi-processor,support,for,coin,generation
,-,Proxy,support

That's,a,good,idea.,The,side,accepting,the,connection,just,needs,to,withhold,from,sending,anything,until,it,receives,a,valid,handshake.,Any,portscan,would,only,get,a,dead,connection,that,doesn't,volunteer,to,identify,itself.

I,have,thought,about,eventually,SSLing,all,the,connections.,I,assume,anything,short,of,SSL,would,be,pointless,against,DPI.,Maybe,a,better,more,immediate,solution,is,to,connect,through,TOR,,which,will,be,possible,with,0.2.

That's,one,of,the,main,things,on,the,agenda,after,0.2.

Yeah,,the,other,stealth,stuff,would,be,kinda,pointless,if,it's,always,the,same,port,number.

I'm,looking,forward,to,trying,UPnP.,Do,most,P2P,clients,typically,have,UPnP,enabled,by,default?

I'm,still,thinking,about,how,best,to,structure,the,management,interface.,Maybe,command,line,commands,to,communicate,with,the,background,daemon,to,query,transactions,received,and,initiate,sending,transfers.,That,would,be,more,automation,friendly.,Or,what,about,an,http,interface,on,some,port,other,than,80,to,manage,it,with,a,browser?

That's,a,good,approach,for,mobile.,Programmatic,API,used,by,PHP,(any,language),to,present,a,web,UI,covers,remote,admin,,mobile,and,any,other,client,that,can't,be,online,all,the,time,with,a,static,IP.,It,would,be,like,webmail.,It,would,be,easier,for,new,users,to,get,started,if,they,only,need,to,create,an,account,on,a,website,,not,install,software.

Yeah,,we,can,phase,out,IRC,when,there,are,enough,static,nodes,to,preprogram,a,seed,list.,Once,you,get,seeded,,you,don't,need,IRC.

There,were,some,issues,in,0.1.5,where,the,initial,block,download,could,get,bogged,down.,0.2,has,code,to,make,sure,it,goes,smoothly.,It,ought,to,take,less,than,an,hour,,I,think.,I,need,to,hurry,up,and,get,0.2,out,the,door.

The,blocks,increase,linearly,,it'll,be,decades,before,it's,millions.,In,theory,,the,block,download,time,should,top,out,8,months,from,now,when,Moore's,Law,will,be,growing,faster,than,the,block,chain.

It's,SVN,on,sourceforge.,PM,or,e-mail,me,your,sourceforge,account,and,I'll,give,you,access.


That's,great,because,that's,where,I,have,less,expertise.,For,instance,,I,haven't,researched,the,best,way,to,do,the,"Start,Bitcoin,on,system,startup",feature,on,Linux.,On,Windows,,the,option,adds/removes,an,icon,in,the,Startup,folder.

For,that,level,of,anonymity,you,need,to,connect,through,TOR,,which,will,be,possible,with,version,0.2,,which,is,only,a,few,weeks,away.,I'll,post,TOR,instructions,at,that,time.

4:
Version,0.1.5:,backup,the,whole,%appdata%\Bitcoin,directory.
Version,0.2:,you,can,backup,just,wallet.dat.

5:
Nope.,The,whole,design,is,all,about,preventing,that,from,working.

6:
Those,coins,can,never,be,recovered,,and,the,total,circulation,is,less.,Since,the,effective,circulation,is,reduced,,all,the,remaining,coins,are,worth,slightly,more.,It's,the,opposite,of,when,a,government,prints,money,and,the,value,of,existing,money,goes,down.

7:
It's,currently,29,296,blocks.,The,circulation,is,the,number,of,blocks,times,50,,so,the,current,circulation,is,1,464,800,bc.,

If,you,only,have,24k,blocks,,it,must,not,have,finished,the,initial,block,download.,Exit,bitcoin,and,start,it,again.,Version,0.2,is,better/faster,at,the,initial,block,download.

8:
Typically,a,few,hundred,right,now.,It's,easy,now,but,it'll,get,harder,as,the,network,grows.

9:
Good,question,,it's,TCP.,The,website,needs,to,be,updated,to,say,TCP,port,8333.

The,port,forwarding,is,so,other,nodes,can,connect,to,you,,so,it,helps,you,stay,connected,because,you,are,able,to,be,connected,with,more,nodes.,You,also,need,it,to,receive,payments,by,IP,address.

10:
No,,the,other,nodes,won't,accept,that.

Being,open,source,means,anyone,can,independently,review,the,code.,If,it,was,closed,source,,nobody,could,verify,the,security.,I,think,it's,essential,for,a,program,of,this,nature,to,be,open,source.

11:
Slower,machines,produce,fewer,coins.,It's,proportional,to,CPU,speed.

12:
There,are,more,coming.

13:
It,uses,a,transactional,database,called,Berkeley,DB.,It,will,not,lose,data,in,a,system,crash.,Transactions,are,written,to,the,database,immediately,when,they're,received.

14:
For,now,,you,can,just,multiply,the,total,blocks,by,50.,The,Bitcoin,network,has,been,running,for,almost,a,year,now.,The,design,and,coding,started,in,2007.

That's,true,,with,the,send-to-IP,option,,you,are,sending,to,whoever,answers,that,IP.,Sending,to,a,bitcoin,address,doesn't,have,that,problem.

The,plan,is,to,implement,an,IP,+,bitcoin,address,option,that,would,have,the,benefits,of,both.,It,would,still,use,a,different,address,for,each,transaction,,but,the,receiver,would,sign,the,one-time-use,address,with,the,given,bitcoin,address,to,prove,it,belongs,to,the,intended,receiver.

That,would,be,a,big,help.,TOR,users,wouldn't,have,to,worry,about,how,to,get,seeded,,and,we,wouldn't,depend,on,IRC.

It,can,be,run,in,a,few,simple,modes,without,access,to,the,UI,if,you,don't,mind,a,minimized,window,on,the,desktop.,(0.1.5,doesn't,have,-min,so,it,would,be,an,open,window)

To,only,run,a,seed:
bitcoin,-min,-gen=0

You,could,sort,of,monitor,it,by,looking,at,debug.log.,To,stop,it,,kill,the,process,,the,database,won't,mind.

To,generate:
bitcoin,-min,-gen

To,get,the,generated,bitcoins,,you'd,have,to,copy,wallet.dat,(with,version,0.2),to,a,machine,with,a,UI,,swap,in,the,wallet.dat,,run,bitcoin,and,transfer,the,coins,to,your,main,account.,(With,version,0.1.5,you'd,have,to,copy,the,whole,"%appdata%/Bitcoin",directory.),There,is,one,caveat,about,copying,wallet.dat:,if,you,happened,to,kill,the,program,at,the,exact,moment,that,it,generated,a,coin,or,received,a,payment,,wallet.dat,might,not,work,by,itself,and,you'd,have,to,copy,the,whole,directory.

I,see,,that,would,happen,with,multiple,nodes,using,the,same,NAT,or,VPN,or,some,ISP,that,funnels,everyone,through,a,few,proxy,servers.,I,just,committed,a,fix,to,SVN,for,this.,If,it,gets,"433",name,already,in,use,(it,was,error,433,,right?),,it'll,retry,with,a,non-address,random,username.,

That's,great,,any,help,is,really,appreciated!

The,average,total,coins,generated,across,the,network,per,day,stays,the,same.,Faster,machines,just,get,a,larger,share,than,slower,machines.,If,everyone,bought,faster,machines,,they,wouldn't,get,more,coins,than,before.

We,should,have,a,gentleman's,agreement,to,postpone,the,GPU,arms,race,as,long,as,we,can,for,the,good,of,the,network.,It's,much,easer,to,get,new,users,up,to,speed,if,they,don't,have,to,worry,about,GPU,drivers,and,compatibility.,It's,nice,how,anyone,with,just,a,CPU,can,compete,fairly,equally,right,now.

Mac,support,would,be,nice.,wxWidgets,really,pays,off,for,cross,platform.

Please,don't,try,PPC.,PPC,is,big-endian,and,Bitcoin,is,little-endian,,there,would,be,endless,endian,bugs,making,it,harder,for,me,to,debug,the,network,if,there's,a,potentially,byte-swapping,node,out,there.,PPC,is,on,its,way,out,anyway.

Considered,autoconf.,Autoconf,is,a,necessity,for,large,projects,with,a,quagmire,makefile,,but,I,think,we're,small,enough,that,it's,more,optimal,without,it.,I'd,rather,keep,the,makefile,simple,as,long,as,possible.

My,head,hurts,just,thinking,about,that.,Funnelling,all,the,UI,backend,through,a,TCP,connection,would,make,everything,twice,as,hard.,There's,too,much,bandwidth,between,the,UI,and,the,internal,data,structures,in,order,to,keep,the,listview,control,updated,,because,of,the,way,the,listview,control,works.

I'd,rather,have,command,line,control,,that,would,get,us,remote,admin,and,batch,automation.

There,would,be,a,command,line,switch,at,runtime,to,tell,it,to,run,without,UI.,All,it,needs,to,do,is,not,create,the,main,window.,A,simplistic,way,would,be,to,disable,"pframeMain->Show",and,"ptaskbaricon->Show",in,ui.cpp.,The,network,threads,don't,care,that,the,UI,isn't,there.,The,only,other,UI,is,a,message,box,in,CheckDiskSpace,if,it,runs,out,of,disk,space.

Then,a,separate,command,line,utility,to,communicate,with,it,to,do,things.,Not,sure,what,it,should,be,named.

"natural,deflation"...,I,like,that,name,for,it.,Yes,,there,will,be,natural,deflation,due,to,payment,mistakes,and,lost,data.,Coin,creation,will,eventually,get,slow,enough,that,it,is,exceeded,by,natural,deflation,and,we'll,have,net,deflation.

Then,it,must,be,something,you're,doing,differently,with,building,or,configuring,wxWidgets.

What,options,did,you,use,on,the,wxWidgets,"configure",script?\u00a0,The,options,I,used,are,in,build-unix.txt.

Never,heard,of,that,happening.\u00a0,Is,there,anything,in,debug.log?\u00a0,If,you,touched,the,file,,that,sounds,like,something,is,there.\u00a0,Does,the,program,have,write,access,to,the,file?

What,you,can,currently,do,is,set,"Minimize,to,the,tray",in,options,,then,run,it,as,"bitcoin,-min",so,it,starts,minimized.,\u00a0The,only,visible,part,will,be,a,small,(20x20),icon,on,the,tray,,which,can,be,doubleclicked,if,you,want,to,access,the,UI.,\u00a0Note:,there's,a,bug,with,tray,icons,sometimes,disappearing,on,64-bit,Karmic,Koala,,not,sure,if,it's,from,64-bit,or,Karmic,,it,was,fine,on,32-bit,Jaunty.

We,didn't,have,time,to,implement,the,"Start,Bitcoin,on,system,startup",feature,on,Linux,in,time,for,0.2,so,it's,greyed,out.,\u00a0I,figured,Linux,people,wouldn't,mind,doing,that,manually,anyway.,\u00a0I,guess,they,need,to,know,about,the,-min,switch,to,do,it,right.

You,can,locate,the,data,directory,where,you,want,with,the,"-datadir=<directory>",switch.,\u00a0I,know,someone,is,already,doing,that,to,put,it,on,a,TrueCrypt,USB,drive.

The,transfer,is,immediate,if,you,send,by,IP,address.,If,you,send,by,bitcoin,address,and,the,recipient,isn't,online,at,the,time,,it,might,take,30,minutes,or,more,to,see,it.,

Also,,the,recipient,needs,to,be,synced,up,with,the,block,chain,before,it'll,see,the,received,transaction.,That,means,the,status,bar,at,the,bottom,needs,to,say,at,least,33000,blocks,,like,"x,connections,33200,blocks,x,transactions".

The,number,of,blocks,of,a,transaction,is,the,amount,of,new,blocks,that,have,been,generated,by,the,whole,network,after,the,transaction.,Each,new,block,in,the,chain,means,new,coins,to,its,creator.,One,"generated",-transaction,in,your,transaction,list,means,that,you,have,generated,one,block.,You're,not,the,first,one,to,find,the,concept,of,a,"block",a,bit,confusing,on,the,first,sight.

Each,block,essentially,means,another,node,has,confirmed,that,it,agrees,with,all,transactions,up,to,that,point.

More,connections,just,add,redundancy.,If,you,only,had,one,connection,,what,if,that,node,is,slow,or,busy,,or,only,connected,to,you?,Having,several,connections,increases,the,certainty,that,you're,well,connected,to,the,network.,That,hasn't,been,a,problem,in,practice,,the,network,is,very,thoroughly,connected.,If,you,have,2,or,3,connections,,you're,fine.

I've,been,thinking,about,that,for,a,while.,I,want,to,add,the,backend,support,for,.onion,addresses,and,connecting,to,them,,then,go,from,there.

There,aren't,many,.onion,addresses,in,use,for,anything,because,the,user,has,to,go,through,a,number,of,steps,to,create,one.,Configure,TOR,to,generate,a,.onion,address,,restart,TOR,,configure,it,with,the,generated,address.,Perhaps,this,is,intentional,to,keep,TOR,so,it,can't,be,integrated,into,file,sharing,programs,in,any,sufficiently,automated,way.

That,is,what,happens,if,you,copy,wallet,files,around.,If,you,copy,your,wallet,file,to,a,second,computer,,then,they,both,think,the,money,in,the,wallet,is,theirs.,If,one,spends,any,of,it,,the,other,doesn't,know,those,coins,are,already,spent,and,would,try,to,spend,them,again,,and,that's,the,error,you,would,hit.

Now,that,it's,clear,this,is,a,key,error,message,,it,ought,to,be,something,more,like,"the,money,appears,to,be,already,spent...,this,could,happen,if,you,used,a,copy,of,your,wallet,file,on,another,computer."

You,can,move,or,backup,your,wallet,file,,but,it,needs,to,have,only,one,"lineage",and,only,used,in,one,place,at,a,time.,Any,time,you,transfer,money,out,of,it,,then,you,must,no,longer,use,any,previous,copies.

This,brings,up,a,good,point.,In,the,case,of,restoring,a,backup,that,may,be,from,before,you,spent,some,coins,,we,need,to,add,functionality,to,resync,it,to,discover,which,coins,have,already,been,spent.,This,would,not,be,hard,to,do,,it,just,hasn't,been,implemented,yet.,I'll,add,it,to,the,list.,This,would,make,it,mostly,repair,the,situation,instead,of,giving,that,error,message.

Yes,,it's,a,technical,limitation.,Sending,by,bitcoin,address,enters,the,transaction,into,the,network,and,the,recipient,discovers,it,from,the,network.,You,don't,connect,directly,with,them,and,they,don't,have,to,be,online,at,the,time.

I,very,much,wanted,to,find,some,way,to,include,a,short,message,,but,the,problem,is,,the,whole,world,would,be,able,to,see,the,message.,As,much,as,you,may,keep,reminding,people,that,the,message,is,completely,non-private,,it,would,be,an,accident,waiting,to,happen.

Unfortunately,,ECDSA,can,only,sign,signatures,,it,can't,encrypt,messages,,and,we,need,the,small,size,of,ECDSA.,RSA,can,encrypt,messages,,but,it's,many,times,bigger,than,ECDSA.

Where,it,says,"#,blocks",in,the,status,column,I'm,changing,it,to,say,"#,confirmations".,That,might,be,clearer.

If,you,doubleclick,on,the,transaction,you,get,a,little,more,information.

The,resync,idea,would,go,through,your,wallet,and,check,it,against,the,block,index,to,find,any,transactions,that,your,current,computer,doesn't,realize,are,already,spent.,That,could,happen,if,they,were,spent,on,another,computer,with,a,copy,of,the,wallet,file,,or,you,had,to,restore,the,wallet,to,a,backup,from,before,they,were,spent.,Currently,,the,software,just,assumes,it,always,knows,whether,its,transactions,are,spent,because,it,marks,them,spent,in,wallet.dat,when,it,spends,them.

A,wallet,merge,tool,is,possible,to,implement,but,much,less,in,demand,once,resync,solves,most,of,the,problem.,With,resync,,you,could,do,about,the,same,thing,by,sending,all,the,money,from,one,wallet,to,the,other.,The,receiver,would,resync,and,discover,all,its,overlapping,coins,were,spent,,then,receive,them,in,the,new,transaction.

That's,the,right,way,to,do,it,as,riX,says.,The,software,can,generate,a,new,bitcoin,address,whenever,you,need,one,for,each,payment.,"Please,send,X,bc,to,[single-use,bitcoin,address],to,complete,your,order",When,the,server,receives,that,amount,to,the,bitcoin,address,,that,could,trigger,it,to,automatically,fulfil,the,order,or,e-mail,the,shop,owner.

Adding,command,line,support,is,a,high,priority.,It's,just,a,matter,of,getting,the,time,to,code,it.

The,recommended,ways,to,do,a,payment,for,an,order:
1),The,merchant,has,a,static,IP,,the,customer,sends,to,it,with,a,comment.
2),The,merchant,creates,a,new,bitcoin,address,,gives,it,to,the,customer,,the,customer,sends,to,that,address.,This,will,be,the,standard,way,for,website,software,to,do,it.

RSA,vs,ECDSA:,it's,not,the,size,of,the,executable,but,the,size,of,the,data.,I,thought,it,would,be,impractical,if,the,block,chain,,bitcoin,addresses,,disk,space,and,bandwidth,requirements,were,all,an,order,of,magnitude,bigger.,Also,,even,if,using,RSA,for,messages,,it,would,still,make,sense,to,do,all,the,bitcoin,network,with,ECDSA,and,use,RSA,in,parallel,for,only,the,message,part.,In,that,case,,everything,that's,been,implemented,up,to,now,would,be,implemented,exactly,as,it,has,been.

We,can,figure,out,the,best,way,to,do,this,much,later.,It,could,use,a,separate,(maybe,existing),e-mail,or,IM,infrastructure,to,pass,messages,,and,instead,of,RSA,,maybe,just,put,a,hash,of,the,message,in,the,transaction,to,prove,that,the,transaction,is,for,the,order,described,in,the,message.,The,message,would,have,to,include,a,salt,so,nobody,could,brute,force,the,hash,to,reveal,a,short,message.

I,committed,a,fix,for,64-bit,compile,and,some,fixes,to,support,wxWidgets,2.9.0.

There,was,one,compile,error,in,serialize.h,with,min(sizeof()),that,I,fixed,for,64-bit.,The,rest,of,the,64-bit,compile,errors,I,was,getting,were,in,wxWidgets,2.8.9,,so,I,started,working,on,supporting,wxWidgets,2.9.0.

wxWidgets,2.9.0,is,UTF-8.,We've,been,using,the,ANSI,version,of,wxWidgets,2.8.9,in,anticipation,of,wxWidgets,UTF-8,support.

I,compiled,and,ran,on,64-bit,Ubuntu,9.10,Karmic.

I,think,the,only,bug,left,is,where,the,status,number,is,mashed,up.,I'm,not,sure,why,,I,have,to,suspect,it's,a,UTF-8,thing,,but,no,idea,how,that,could,happen.,Haven't,looked,into,it.

build-unix.txt,is,updated,and,two,makefiles,on,SVN:
makefile.unix.wx2.8
makefile.unix.wx2.9

Unfortunately,there's,still,no,debian,package,for,either,version,of,wxWidgets,we,use.,They,only,have,the,wchar,("unicode"),version,of,wxWidgets,2.8,,which,is,a,disaster,because,wchar,wxString,doesn't,convert,to,std::string.,We,use,either,ANSI,wxWidgets,2.8,,or,wxWidgets,2.9.,So,you,still,have,to,get,it,and,build,it,yourself.

I,uploaded,this,fix,to,the,SVN.,It,watches,for,spent,coins,and,updates,your,wallet,on,load,and,also,continuously,as,blocks,come,in.,I,also,put,a,better,error,message,,but,it,should,never,hit,it,because,it,always,finds,spent,coins,ahead,of,time,,unless,you,spent,the,same,money,at,the,same,time,on,two,computers,at,once.

If,you,want,to,try,it,,PM,or,e-mail,me,your,e-mail,address,where,I,can,send,it,as,an,attachment,and,also,what,OS,(win,,linux,32-bit,,linux,64-bit).

Thanks,for,that.,Which,version,of,Windows?

Port,forwarding,forwards,a,port,to,one,computer.,It,tells,the,router,which,computer,handles,connections,to,that,port.,So,that's,the,computer,receiving.

If,you,didn't,set,up,port,forwarding,,then,incoming,connections,won't,go,to,any,computer,,and,attempts,to,send,to,that,IP,would,just,say,it,couldn't,connect,to,the,recipient,and,nothing,is,sent.,When,sending,by,IP,,you,still,send,to,a,bitcoin,address,,but,your,computer,connects,to,that,IP,,gets,a,new,bitcoin,address,from,it,,gives,the,transaction,directly,to,the,them,and,confirms,that,it,was,received,and,accepted.

Someone,should,post,their,static,IP,so,people,can,try,out,sending,by,IP,and,also,give,that,user,free,money.

There's,a,32-bit,checksum,in,bitcoin,addresses,so,you,can't,accidentally,type,an,invalid,address.

If,4),you,send,to,a,recipient,who,has,abandoned,or,lost,their,wallet.dat,,then,the,money,is,lost.,A,subtle,point,can,be,made,that,since,there,is,then,less,total,money,in,circulation,,everyone's,remaining,money,is,worth,slightly,more,,aka,"natural,deflation".

When,using,proxy,port,9050,,it,will,only,make,one,attempt,to,connect,to,IRC,,then,give,up,,since,it,knows,it,will,probably,always,fail,because,IRC,servers,ban,all,the,TOR,exit,nodes.,If,you're,using,another,port,,it,would,assume,it,might,be,a,regular,old,normal,proxy,and,would,keep,retrying,IRC,at,longer,and,longer,intervals.,You,should,not,use,Polipo,or,Privoxy,as,those,are,http,filters,and,caches,that,would,corrupt,Bitcoin's,messages,if,they,make,any,changes.,Bitcoin,might,be,trying,to,overcome,it,by,reconnecting.,You,should,use,port,9050.

As,riX,says,,the,"is,giving,Tor,only,an,IP,address.,Apps,that,do,DNS...",warnings,are,nothing,to,worry,about.,Bitcoin,doesn't,use,DNS,at,all,in,proxy,mode.

Since,Bitcoin,can't,get,through,to,IRC,through,Tor,,it,doesn't,know,which,nodes,are,currently,online,,so,it,has,to,try,all,the,recently,seen,nodes.,It,tries,to,conserve,connection,attempts,as,much,as,possible,,but,also,people,want,it,to,connect,quickly,when,they,start,it,up,and,reconnect,quickly,if,disconnected.,It,uses,an,algorithm,where,it,tries,an,IP,less,and,less,frequently,the,longer,ago,it,was,successful,connected.,For,example,,for,a,node,it,saw,24,hours,ago,,it,would,wait,5,hours,between,connection,attempts.,Once,it,has,at,least,2,connections,,it,won't,try,anything,over,a,week,old,,and,5,connections,it,won't,try,anything,over,24,hours,old.

We,had,our,first,automatic,adjustment,of,the,proof-of-work,difficulty,on,30,Dec,2009.,

The,minimum,difficulty,is,32,zero,bits,,so,even,if,only,one,person,was,running,a,node,,the,difficulty,doesn't,get,any,easier,than,that.,For,most,of,last,year,,we,were,hovering,below,the,minimum.,On,30,Dec,we,broke,above,it,and,the,algorithm,adjusted,to,more,difficulty.,It's,been,getting,more,difficult,at,each,adjustment,since,then.

The,adjustment,on,04,Feb,took,it,up,from,1.34,times,last,year's,difficulty,to,1.82,times,more,difficult,than,last,year.,That,means,you,generate,only,55%,as,many,coins,for,the,same,amount,of,work.

The,difficulty,adjusts,proportionally,to,the,total,effort,across,the,network.,If,the,number,of,nodes,doubles,,the,difficulty,will,also,double,,returning,the,total,generated,to,the,target,rate.

For,those,technically,inclined,,the,proof-of-work,difficulty,can,be,seen,by,searching,on,"target:",in,debug.log.,It's,a,256-bit,unsigned,hex,number,,which,the,SHA-256,value,has,to,be,less,than,to,successfully,generate,a,block.,It,gets,adjusted,every,2016,blocks,,typically,two,weeks.,That's,when,it,prints,"GetNextWorkRequired,RETARGET",in,debug.log.

That's,not,possible.,You've,handed,control,of,the,money,over,to,the,recipient's,keypair.,Only,that,key,can,control,it.

It's,similar,to,if,you,encrypt,a,file,with,AES,and,a,strong,password,,and,you,lose,the,password.,The,data,is,lost.

When,you,send,to,a,bitcoin,address,,you,don't,connect,to,the,recipient.,You,send,the,transaction,to,the,network,the,same,way,you,relay,transactions.,There's,no,distinction,between,a,transaction,you,originated,and,one,you,received,from,another,node,that,you're,relaying,in,a,broadcast.,With,a,very,small,network,though,,someone,might,still,figure,it,out,by,process,of,elimination.,It'll,be,better,when,the,network,is,larger.

If,you,send,by,IP,,the,recipient,sees,you,because,you,connect,to,their,IP.,You,could,use,TOR,to,mask,that.

You,could,use,TOR,if,you,don't,want,anyone,to,know,you're,even,using,Bitcoin.

Bitcoin,is,still,very,new,and,has,not,been,independently,analysed.,If,you're,serious,about,privacy,,TOR,is,an,advisable,precaution.

Eventually,at,most,only,21,million,coins,for,6.8,billion,people,in,the,world,if,it,really,gets,huge.

But,don't,worry,,there,are,another,6,decimal,places,that,aren't,shown,,for,a,total,of,8,decimal,places,internally.,It,shows,1.00,but,internally,it's,1.00000000.,If,there's,massive,deflation,in,the,future,,the,software,could,show,more,decimal,places.

If,it,gets,tiresome,working,with,small,numbers,,we,could,change,where,the,display,shows,the,decimal,point.,Same,amount,of,money,,just,different,convention,for,where,the,","'s,and,"."'s,go.,e.g.,moving,the,decimal,place,3,places,would,mean,if,you,had,1.00000,before,,now,it,shows,it,as,1,000.00.

No,,sorry.,I've,been,meaning,to,redo,it.,The,largest,icon,that,still,looks,good,is,the,20x20,one,which,is,used,for,the,tray,icon,in,GNOME.,Any,larger,than,that,looks,bad.,The,16x16,and,20x20,ones,have,quite,a,bit,of,hand,tweaking,to,get,the,pixels,to,work,out,right.,If,you,just,scale,down,a,larger,image,,the,pixels,end,up,blurred,and,awkward,in,places,where,the,lines,in,"BC",don't,land,square,on,a,pixel.

The,best,16x16,with,full,alpha,channel,is,in,src/rc/bitcoin.ico.,I,don't,like,the,32x32,version.

I'm,attaching,bitcoin20x20.png,,the,20x20,version,with,full,transparency.

Thank,you,for,the,offer,to,help,translate.,That,is,probably,the,best,way,you,could,help.

I,will,need,to,prepare,the,code,for,translation,first.,wxWidgets,has,locale,support,,and,most,strings,are,in,generated,code,that,is,already,wrapped,,so,it,shouldn't,be,too,hard.,We,also,must,finish,upgrading,to,wxWidgets-2.9.0,to,get,UTF-8,support.,I've,done,test,builds,with,2.9.0,and,there,is,one,bug,left,to,fix.

What,operating,system,are,you,using?,Windows,,Linux,32-bit,or,64,bit?

It's,much,easier,to,have,a,single,binary,and,multiple,.mo,files.,It's,too,much,maintenance,work,to,have,lots,of,build,variations.,Once,the,software,support,is,implemented,,anyone,could,contribute,translations.

wxWidgets,uses,the,gettext,standard.,You,use,the,gettext,tools,or,something,like,poedit,to,create,a,.po,file,by,scanning,the,sourcefiles,for,strings,and,editing,the,translations,into,the,.po,file,,then,compile,it,into,a,.mo,file.,The,program,loads,the,.mo,file,at,runtime,and,reskins,all,the,strings.,Additional,languages,can,be,added,to,an,existing,program,by,adding,.mo,files,without,recompiling,the,program.

On,Windows,,the,.mo,files,would,go,in,a,lang,subdirectory,in,the,directory,where,the,EXE,is,located.

Right,now,I'm,working,on,JSON-RPC,and,command,line,support,,but,when,I'm,finished,with,that,I,hope,to,do,this,next.

Are,you,just,trying,to,run,the,program,or,do,you,really,need,to,compile,it?,There's,a,32-bit,linux,binary,that,can,be,run,on,64-bit,ubuntu,if,you,"sudo,apt-get,ia32-libs".
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.2.0-linux.tar.gz/download

I,recently,updated,the,SVN,for,building,on,64-bit,Karmic,with,wxWidgets,2.9.0.,This,was,after,the,0.2.0,release.,The,0.2.0,release,did,not,build,on,64-bit,yet.

Unfortunately,there,currently,isn't,a,-dev,deb,package,of,either,of,the,versions,of,wxWidgets,that,we,can,use.,On,Karmic,they,only,have,the,UTF-16,version.,We,need,either,the,ANSI,(libwxgtk2.8-ansi-dev),version,or,the,UTF-8,(wxWidgets,2.9.0),version.,We're,moving,towards,2.9.0.

I,know,you,said,you,didn't,want,VM,,but,as,a,last,resort,,last,I,checked,the,Windows,version,runs,fine,in,Wine.

There's,a,small,transaction,fee,for,very,large,transactions.,The,node,that,generates,the,block,that,contains,the,transaction,gets,the,fee.

If,the,same,money,gets,sent,again,,it,won't,incur,the,fee,again.,If,all,you,have,is,generated,coins,in,your,wallet,,if,you,send,them,all,in,one,huge,transaction,,it,has,to,bundle,hundreds,of,50,bc,coins,together.,After,that,it's,just,one,line,to,send,the,combined,unit.

Am,I,missing,something?,Is,there,something,wrong,with,the,32-bit,linux,precompiled,binary,on,bitcoin.org?

The,bitcoin,binary,in,the,distribution,static,links,the,wxWidgets,library,,and,its,shared,links,(openssl,and,GTK),are,included,in,Ubuntu,,so,it,can,run,without,needing,to,be,a,.deb,to,pull,down,dependencies.

Since,we're,upgrading,to,wxWidgets,2.9.0,for,UTF-8,,which,doesn't,have,a,DEB,package,yet,,we'll,continue,to,need,to,static,link,it.

True,,sending,by,IP,through,Tor,trades,one,problem,for,another.,The,Tor,exit,node,can,see,the,text,of,your,message,and,potentially,MITM,you.

Best,to,only,send,to,bitcoin,addresses,then.,Payments,by,bitcoin,address,are,broadcast,over,the,network,as,part,of,the,normal,network,traffic.,All,communications,with,the,network,are,broadcasts,of,public,information.

Almost,all,transactions,are,free.,A,transaction,is,over,the,maximum,size,limit,if,it,has,to,add,up,more,than,500,of,the,largest,payments,you've,received,to,make,up,the,amount.,A,transaction,over,the,size,limit,can,still,be,sent,if,a,small,fee,is,added.

The,average,transaction,,and,anything,up,to,500,times,bigger,than,average,,is,free.

It's,only,when,you're,sending,a,really,huge,transaction,that,the,transaction,fee,ever,comes,into,play,,and,even,then,it,only,works,out,to,something,like,0.002%,of,the,amount.,It's,not,money,sucked,out,of,the,system,,it,just,goes,to,other,nodes.,If,you're,sad,about,paying,the,fee,,you,could,always,turn,the,tables,and,run,a,node,yourself,and,maybe,someday,rake,in,a,0.44,fee,yourself.

Right.,Otherwise,we,couldn't,have,a,finite,limit,of,21,million,coins,,because,there,would,always,need,to,be,some,minimum,reward,for,generating.,In,a,few,decades,when,the,reward,gets,too,small,,the,transaction,fee,will,become,the,main,compensation,for,nodes.,I'm,sure,that,in,20,years,there,will,either,be,very,large,transaction,volume,or,no,volume.

Right,now,there,isn't,a,port,number,setting,to,do,that.,It's,a,feature,yet,to,be,implemented.,You,can,only,set,up,your,NAT,to,port-forward,to,one,of,the,computers.,(I,said,something,earlier,about,NAT,port,translation,,but,that,wouldn't,work,,other,nodes,wouldn't,know,to,connect,to,that,port)

If,you,want,,as,a,small,optimization,,you,could,run,the,rest,of,your,computers,as:
bitcoin,-connect=<the,IP,of,the,first,computer>

so,they,get,all,their,network,communication,from,the,first,computer,and,don't,all,connect,over,the,net,individually,for,the,same,information.,This,saves,bandwidth,,although,it,doesn't,use,much,bandwidth,to,begin,with,,so,it,wouldn't,really,matter,unless,you,had,tons,of,computers.

For,redundancy,in,case,the,first,computer,goes,down,,you,could,have,two,that,connect,out,and,the,rest,connect,to,both,of,them.,The,first,two,are,run,normally,,the,rest,are,run,like:
bitcoin,-connect=<IP1>,-connect=<IP2>

I,thought,about,that,but,there,wasn't,a,practical,way,to,do,smaller,increments.,The,frequency,of,block,generation,is,balanced,between,confirming,transactions,as,fast,as,possible,and,the,latency,of,the,network.

The,algorithm,aims,for,an,average,of,6,blocks,per,hour.,If,it,was,5,bc,and,60,per,hour,,there,would,be,10,times,as,many,blocks,and,the,initial,block,download,would,take,10,times,as,long.,It,wouldn't,work,anyway,because,that,would,be,only,1,minute,average,between,blocks,,too,close,to,the,broadcast,latency,when,the,network,gets,larger.

Probably,OK,,but,I'm,not,sure.,The,protocol,is,designed,to,resync,to,the,next,message,,and,messages,get,re-requested,from,all,the,other,nodes,you're,connected,to,until,received.,If,you,miss,a,block,,it'll,also,keep,requesting,it,every,time,another,blocks,comes,in,and,it,sees,there's,a,gap.,Before,the,original,release,I,did,a,test,dropping,1,out,of,4,random,messages,under,heavy,load,until,I,could,run,it,overnight,without,any,nodes,getting,stuck.

Nodes,stop,trying,to,initiate,connections,once,they,have,15.,If,you,can,accept,incoming,connections,,then,you,can,get,well,above,that,from,nodes,connecting,to,you,,otherwise,you,max,out,at,15.

I,don't,know,if,there's,any,reason,to,have,15,connections.,Maybe,it,should,be,10.

Since,nodes,that,can,only,connect,out,are,probably,at,or,near,15,most,of,the,time,now,,you,should,level,off,to,an,equilibrium.,45,suggests,a,ratio,of,3,out-only,nodes,to,every,1,in-accepting,node.

The,number,of,connections,won't,be,a,good,gauge,of,the,size,of,the,network,any,more.,Someone,should,periodically,IRC,to,the,bitcoin,channel,on,chat.freenode.net,and,count,the,number,of,users.,That,gives,you,the,total,count,of,network,nodes,(except,TOR,nodes).

Block,generation,is,again,running,ahead,of,pace.,We're,in,for,another,big,step,up,in,difficulty,at,the,next,adjustment,in,about,5,days.

It,would,be,nice,to,have,a,list,of,static,IPs,for,new,users,to,send,test,donations,to,so,they,can,see,how,the,software,works.,If,you,can,accept,incoming,connections,and,you,have,a,static,IP,address,,post,it,here!

Anything,sent,to,these,IPs,should,be,considered,a,donation.,

If,you,do,request,a,round-trip,,be,sure,to,include,your,return,bitcoin,address,or,IP,in,the,comment,,but,please,assume,it'll,be,one-way.,They,won't,necessarily,be,watching,for,incoming,transactions,to,send,back.

A,rational,market,price,for,something,that,is,expected,to,increase,in,value,will,already,reflect,the,present,value,of,the,expected,future,increases.,In,your,head,,you,do,a,probability,estimate,balancing,the,odds,that,it,keeps,increasing.

In,the,absence,of,a,market,to,establish,the,price,,NewLibertyStandard's,estimate,based,on,production,cost,is,a,good,guess,and,a,helpful,service,(thanks).,The,price,of,any,commodity,tends,to,gravitate,toward,the,production,cost.,If,the,price,is,below,cost,,then,production,slows,down.,If,the,price,is,above,cost,,profit,can,be,made,by,generating,and,selling,more.,At,the,same,time,,the,increased,production,would,increase,the,difficulty,,pushing,the,cost,of,generating,towards,the,price.

In,later,years,,when,new,coin,generation,is,a,small,percentage,of,the,existing,supply,,market,price,will,dictate,the,cost,of,production,more,than,the,other,way,around.

At,the,moment,,generation,effort,is,rapidly,increasing,,suggesting,people,are,estimating,the,present,value,to,be,higher,than,the,current,cost,of,production.

Instead,of,View->Show,Generated,,we,now,have,tabs:
-,All,Transactions
-,Sent/Received
-,Sent
-,Received

Makes,it,a,lot,easier,to,flip,to,received,and,check,for,payments.

Moved,the,"Your,Addresses",book,inside,the,main,address,book.,It,was,confusing,having,two,address,books.

I,found,the,"To:",in,"From:,unknown,,To:,(one,of,your,bitcoin,addresses)",still,confusing,,so,I,changed,it,to,"From:,unknown,,Received,with:".,The,bitcoin,address,is,abbreviated,so,you,can,see,the,label,that,you,set,in,the,Receiving,tab,of,the,address,book.

Fixed,a,few,UI,glitches,from,the,upgrade,to,wxWidgets,2.9.0.

I,haven't,forgotten,about,you,people,who,want,non-UI,,but,I,had,to,do,some,fun,stuff,before,more,build,bashing.

Just,a,random,streak,of,bad,luck.,It,looks,steady,to,me.

Competition,doesn't,have,an,effect,until,the,next,automatic,retarget,adjustment,,and,we,haven't,reached,the,next,one,yet.

The,adjustments,are,every,2016,blocks.,To,calculate,our,progress,towards,the,next,one,,divide,the,block,total,by,2016.,The,fractional,part,is,how,far,we,are,to,the,next,one.,

My,back-of-the-envelope,projection:,42032,blocks/2016,=,20.85,=,85%,of,the,way.,About,1.5,days,to,go,until,the,next,one.,That'll,only,be,about,10,days,since,the,last,one,,the,target,is,14,days,,so,14/10,=,1.4,=,around,40%,difficulty,increase.

There,are,now,"Sending",and,"Receiving",tabs,in,the,Address,Book.,Your,addresses,are,referred,to,as,"receiving,addresses".

madhatter,was,working,on,building,it,on,Mac.,He,had,errors,probably,caused,by,UTF-16,wxWidgets,2.8.,Should,have,better,luck,now,with,2.9.0.,wxWidgets,2.9.0,is,UTF-8,and,wouldn't,have,that,problem.

I,think,he,had,it,working,on,FreeBSD,,but,he,wanted,a,non-UI,version.

I,have,the,command,line,and,JSON-RPC,daemon,version,working,now.,Will,SVN,it,in,a,day,or,two.

I,disabled,gdm,on,my,Ubuntu,system,so,it,boots,into,command,line.,I,hope,I,will,be,able,to,get,it,enabled,again,with,rcconf.

There's,a,separate,public/private,keypair,for,every,bitcoin,address.,You,don't,have,a,single,private,key,that,unlocks,everything.,Bitcoin,addresses,are,a,160-bit,hash,of,the,public,key,,everything,else,in,the,system,is,256-bit.

If,there,was,a,collision,,the,collider,could,spend,any,money,sent,to,that,address.,Just,money,sent,to,that,address,,not,the,whole,wallet.

If,you,were,to,intentionally,try,to,make,a,collision,,it,would,currently,take,2^126,times,longer,to,generate,a,colliding,bitcoin,address,than,to,generate,a,block.,You,could,have,got,a,lot,more,money,by,generating,blocks.

The,random,seed,is,very,thorough.,On,Windows,,it,uses,all,the,performance,monitor,data,that,measures,every,bit,of,disk,performance,,network,card,metrics,,cpu,time,,paging,etc.,since,your,computer,started.,Linux,has,a,built-in,entropy,collector.,Adding,to,that,,every,time,you,move,your,mouse,inside,the,Bitcoin,window,you're,generating,entropy,,and,entropy,is,captured,from,the,timing,of,disk,ops.

Ah,yes,,there,we,go,,back,to,normal,again.

The,ctrl+alt+F[1-8],thing,never,worked,on,this,computer.,The,screen,just,goes,haywire.

No,,each,generated,transaction,uses,a,new,,single-use,address.

Nothing,uses,the,address,in,the,main,window,,it's,just,there,for,convenience,for,you,to,copy.,0.2.5,has,a,"New...",button,next,to,it,to,make,it,easy,to,change,each,time,you,use,it.

That,would,be,nice,at,point-of-sale.,The,cash,register,displays,a,QR-code,encoding,a,bitcoin,address,and,amount,on,a,screen,and,you,photo,it,with,your,mobile.

How,much,"dealing,with",does,GTK,actually,require?,Is,it,just,a,matter,of,"sudo,apt-get,install,libgtk2.0-0",and,having,some,extra,libraries,sitting,around?,GTK,doesn't,have,to,do,anything,,just,be,there,for,bitcoin,to,link,to,when,it,loads,up,,have,the,gtk-init-check,call,fail,because,no,GUI,present,,then,it's,done.,

It,saves,us,butchering,everything,with,ifdefs,and,a,separate,compile,and,binary,to,use,wxBase,just,to,try,to,avoid,linking,GTK.

The,perspective,shadow,was,too,thick,on,the,larger,sizes.,I,updated,32,,48,and,the,full,size.

I,release,these,images,into,the,public,domain,(copyright-free).,I,request,that,derivative,works,be,made,public,domain.

If,you,GPL,stuff,,I,have,to,avoid,using,it.,Nothing,against,GPL,per-se,,but,Bitcoin,is,an,MIT,license,project.,Anything,GPL,please,clearly,mark,it,as,such

When,and,how,fast,did,memory,usage,increase?,Right,away,,slowly,over,a,long,time,,or,starting,at,some,later,event?

I,have,-daemon,running,on,ubuntu,9.10,64-bit,and,memory,usage,is,steady.

It,has,to,be,something,about,the,difference,on,the,server,besides,64-bit.,Maybe,some,malfunction,from,the,lack,of,GUI.,A,memory,leak,debug,tool,could,give,a,clue.

Yes,,the,original,is,546x531,pixels.

It,looks,good,at,larger,size,too,,but,since,the,small,icons,are,what,you,mostly,always,see,,I,wanted,to,judge,it,on,those,first.,I'll,post,larger,sizes,and,full,size,a,little,later.

Sure,feels,like,it,could,be,something,in,wxWidgets,retrying,endlessly,because,some,UI,thing,failed,or,something,wasn't,inited,correctly.,Our,hack,to,ignore,the,initialize,failure,and,run,anyway,means,we're,in,uncharted,territory.,We're,relying,on,the,fact,that,we,hardly,use,wx,in,this,mode.,We,do,still,use,a,few,things,like,wxGetTranslation,and,wxMutex.

Another,way,to,debug,would,be,to,run,in,gdb,,wait,until,everything,is,quiet,and,all,threads,should,be,idle,,and,break,it,and,see,which,thread,is,busily,doing,something,and,what,it's,doing.

I,suspect,bitcoind,will,probably,work,fine,,but,I,hope,you,can,still,debug,the,problem.

The,formula,is,based,on,the,time,it,takes,to,generate,2016,blocks.,The,difficulty,is,multiplied,by,14/(actual,days,taken).,For,instance,,this,time,it,took,9.4,days,,so,the,calculation,was,14/9.4,=,1.49.,Previous,difficulty,2.53,*,1.49,=,3.78,,a,49%,increase.

I,don't,know,what,you're,talking,about,accepting,easier,difficulties.

Good,suggestion.,I,made,the,B,slightly,lighter,and,the,background,slightly,darker.,Very,slightly.,The,foreground,is,now,exactly,the,same,colour,as,the,BC,in,the,old,one.

It's,kind,of,OK,if,you,can't,easily,read,the,B,in,the,16x16.,At,that,size,,you,just,need,to,see,that,it's,a,coin.,It,doesn't,matter,so,much,what's,embossed,on,it,,just,that,there,be,some,detail,there,because,it,wouldn't,look,like,a,coin,if,it,was,a,blank,smooth,circle.

It's,slightly,wider,than,tall,because,the,dark,perspective,under,it,goes,more,to,the,right,than,down.

I,finished,and,posted,the,32x31,and,48x47,versions,in,the,first,message.,I,like,the,48,a,lot.

How,does,everyone,feel,about,the,B,symbol,with,the,two,lines,through,the,outside?,Can,we,live,with,that,as,our,logo?

I,don't,know,how,to,do,SVG,,but,I,did,the,original,very,large,,over,500,pixels,across,,so,it,can,be,scaled,down.,I'll,give,the,original,when,I'm,finished.

I,had,to,custom,tweak,each,icon,size,so,the,vertical,lines,land,square,on,their,pixels,,otherwise,they're,ugly,blurry,and,inconsistent.,Such,is,the,challenge,of,making,icons.,The,original,will,be,good,for,scaling,to,custom,sizes,between,48,and,500,but,not,smaller.

In,the,Windows,world,,"unicode",means,UTF-16,(wchar).

2.8,has,two,build,variations,,ANSI,and,UTF-16,(unicode).,The,UTF-16,version,is,the,"unicode",version,provided,in,the,Debian,package.,I,believe,2.8,and,its,UTF-16,build,labelled,simply,"unicode",has,been,the,source,of,build,problems,described,in,the,forum.,We,were,previously,using,2.8,ANSI,in,anticipation,of,getting,to,UTF-8,without,going,through,UTF-16,hell.,We,cannot,compile,with,UTF-16.

2.9,has,only,one,version,,UTF-8.,On,Windows,,we,set,the,codepage,to,UTF-8,,so,on,all,platforms,our,code,is,UTF-8,and,wxWidgets,interfaces,with,us,in,UTF-8.,On,Linux,I,assume,the,codepage,is,already,UTF-8.,By,standardizing,on,2.9,we,avoid,the,multi-build,confusion,of,2.8,,and,we,need,2.9,for,UTF-8,internationalization.

Make,sure,you,read,build-unix.txt,and,configure,wxWidgets,using,the,configure,parameters,given.

Curious,,why,is,it,incredibly,hard,to,provide,wxWidgets,2.9.0?,If,you,mean,for,users,,that's,why,we,static,link,it.

It's,unfortunate,that,we,require,so,many,big,dependencies,,but,we,need,them,all.,At,least,on,Debian/Ubuntu,,all,but,wxWidgets,are,available,as,packages.,Eventually,they'll,provide,a,2.9,package.

When,there's,enough,scale,,maybe,there,can,be,an,exchange,site,that,doesn't,do,transfers,,just,matches,up,buyers,and,sellers,to,exchange,with,each,other,directly,,similar,to,how,e-bay,works.

To,make,it,safer,,the,exchange,site,could,act,as,an,escrow,for,the,bitcoin,side,of,the,payment.,The,seller,puts,the,bitcoin,payment,in,escrow,,and,the,buyer,sends,the,conventional,payment,directly,to,the,seller.,The,exchange,service,doesn't,handle,any,real,world,money.

This,would,be,a,step,better,than,e-bay.,E-bay,manages,to,work,fine,even,though,shipped,goods,can't,be,recovered,if,payment,falls,through.

When,you,want,to,upload,an,image,to,embed,in,a,forum,post,,there,are,services,like,imageshack,,but,because,they're,free,,they,limit,the,number,of,views.,It's,a,minuscule,amount,of,bandwidth,cost,,but,they,can't,just,give,it,away,for,free,,there,has,to,be,something,in,it,for,them.,It,would,be,nice,to,be,able,to,pay,for,the,bandwidth,and,avoid,the,limits,,but,conventional,payments,are,too,inconvenient,for,such,a,minor,thing.

It's,worse,if,you,want,to,upload,a,file,for,others,to,download.,There,are,services,like,rapidshare,,but,they,require,the,downloaders,to,go,through,extra,steps,and,delays,to,make,them,look,at,advertising,or,encourage,upgrading,to,a,paid,subscription,,and,they,limit,it,to,10,or,so,downloads.

It,would,be,nice,if,we,made,some,free,PHP,code,for,an,image,and,file,hosting,service,that,charges,Bitcoins.,Anyone,with,some,extra,bandwidth,quota,could,throw,it,on,their,webserver,and,run,it.,Users,could,finally,pay,the,minor,fee,to,cover,bandwidth,cost,and,avoid,the,limits,and,hassles.,Ideally,,it,should,be,MIT,license,or,public,domain.

Services,like,this,would,be,great,for,anonymous,users,,who,have,trouble,paying,for,things.

Thanks,soultcer,for,talking,with,the,Freenode,staffer.,Good,to,know,it's,OK,at,the,current,size,,and,now,they,know,who,we,are.,They're,supportive,of,projects,like,TOR,so,I,hope,they,would,probably,be,friendly,to,us.,We,don't,want,to,overstay,our,welcome.,If,we,get,too,big,,then,by,the,same,token,,we're,big,enough,that,we,don't,need,IRC,anymore,and,we'll,get,off.

We,only,needed,IRC,because,nobody,had,a,static,IP.,In,the,early,days,there,were,some,steady,supporters,,but,they,all,had,pool-allocated,IPs,that,change,every,few,days.,IRC,was,only,intended,as,a,temporary,solution.,Bitcoin's,built-in,addr,system,is,the,main,solution.

Bitcoin,can,get,the,list,of,IPs,from,any,bitcoin,node.,In,that,sense,,every,node,serves,as,a,directory,server.

When,there,are,enough,static,IP,nodes,to,have,a,good,chance,that,at,least,one,will,still,be,running,by,the,time,the,current,version,goes,out,of,use,,we,can,preprogram,a,seed,list.

How,do,you,think,we,should,compile,the,seed,list?,Would,it,be,OK,to,create,it,from,the,currently,connected,IPs,that,have,been,static,for,a,while?

BTW,,if,we,want,to,supplement,by,deploying,separate,directory,server,software,,may,I,suggest,IRC?,IRC,is,a,good,directory,server,(I've,heard,it,has,other,uses,too),,and,there,are,mature,IRC,server,implementations,available,that,anyone,can,run.,Smiley,Bitcoin's,IRC,client,implementation,is,already,thoroughly,tested.

That's,a,great,idea.,There's,a,thriving,business,in,those,services,,but,I've,always,thought,the,standard,payment,methods,are,at,odds,with,privacy,minded,customers.

Would,you,consider,making,your,software,freely,available,so,anyone,could,easily,set,one,up?,I,know,for,competitive,reasons,the,inclination,is,to,keep,it,to,yourself,,but,it,could,get,an,order,of,magnitude,more,use,if,anyone,could,give,proxy,access,to,their,country,just,by,putting,the,software,on,a,server.

I,wonder,if,there,are,other,kinds,of,web,application,servers,where,we,would,only,have,to,tack,on,the,payment,mechanism,to,an,already,existing,system?

It's,unrelated.,There,wasn't,anything,there,when,I,started.

The,price,of,.com,registrations,is,lower,than,it,should,be,,therefore,any,good,name,you,might,think,of,is,always,already,taken,by,some,domain,name,speculator.,Fortunately,,it's,standard,for,open,source,projects,to,be,.org.

LR,and,Pecunix,have,many,established,exchanges,to,paper,currencies,by,various,payment,methods,,and,a,number,of,vendors,accept,them,as,payment,,so,an,exchange,link,between,Bitcoin,and,LR/Pecunix,would,give,us,2nd-hop,access,to,all,that.,The,possibility,to,cash,out,through,them,would,help,support,the,value,of,bitcoins.

Bitcoin,has,unique,properties,that,would,be,complementary.,LR/Pecunix,are,easy,to,spend,anonymously,,but,hard,to,buy,anonymously,and,not,worth,the,trouble,to,buy,in,small,amounts.,Bitcoin,,on,the,other,hand,,is,easy,to,get,in,small,amounts,anonymously.,It,would,be,convenient,to,buy,LR/Pecunix,with,bitcoins,rather,than,through,conventional,payment,methods.

Most,customers,who,convert,to,LR,to,buy,something,would,probably,ask,the,seller,first,if,they,accept,Bitcoin,,encouraging,them,to,start,accepting,it.

Mihalism,Multi,Host,is,a,popular,open,source,PHP,file,hosting,server.

It's,geared,toward,image,hosting,,but,I,think,by,increasing,the,file,size,limit,and,liberalising,the,allowed,file,extensions,,it,could,just,as,easily,be,used,for,general,file,upload,hosting.,They,need,the,limits,to,keep,it,reasonable,as,a,free,service,,but,if,we,bolt,on,a,Bitcoin,payment,mechanism,,the,limits,could,be,relaxed.

It,doesn't,have,a,bunch,of,client,side,scripting,or,anti-embedding,junk,to,rip,out.,It,generates,standard,links,that,work,normally.

There's,a,turnover,churn,in,these,free,hosting,sites.,Small,sites,can,give,free,image,hosting,,but,once,one,starts,getting,popular,,it,gets,too,swamped,with,moochers,using,them,for,free,bandwidth.,Any,site,that,gets,well,known,has,to,become,more,aggressively,pay-naggy,to,cover,bandwidth,costs.,It's,a,perfect,example,of,a,service,where,the,needed,price,point,is,in,the,no-man's-land,between,just,a,little,too,expensive,to,be,free,,but,too,cheap,for,most,users,to,take,the,trouble,of,a,conventional,payment.,It's,in,the,gap,between,0,and,19.95.,The,best,they,can,do,is,try,to,maybe,get,1,out,of,1000,users,to,pay,9.95,,but,that,has,999/1000,users,treated,like,freeloaders.,It,can't,really,be,advertising,supported,because,the,images,are,embedded,in,other,sites,and,downloaded,without,going,to,the,hosting,site.

When,you,generate,a,new,bitcoin,address,,it,only,takes,disk,space,on,your,own,computer,(like,500,bytes).,It's,like,generating,a,new,PGP,private,key,,but,less,CPU,intensive,because,it's,ECC.,The,address,space,is,effectively,unlimited.,It,doesn't,hurt,anyone,,so,generate,all,you,want.

That's,a,good,idea.,At,the,very,least,a,warning,dialog,explaining,that,it'll,connect,to,the,IP,and,send,the,information,cleartext,,giving,the,chance,to,cancel.

I,think,we,can,do,that.

Although,it,would,be,possible,for,Bitcoin,to,take,care,of,business,in,the,HTTP,response,by,presenting,HTML,UI,to,the,user,,as,a,user,I,would,wonder,if,some,website,is,trying,to,trick,me,or,if,I'm,really,talking,to,my,own,Bitcoin,server.

The,HTTP,response,could,simply,be,HTML,with,the,JavaScript,equivalent,of,the,back,button,,sending,it,back,to,the,page.,Bitcoin,then,pops,up,the,Send,Bitcoins,dialog,with,the,destination,bitcoin,address,and,amount,already,filled,in.,It,would,work,just,like,a,mailto:,link,that,pops,up,a,new,email,with,the,address,filled,in.

127.0.0.1,loopback,is,accessible,by,any,user,on,the,machine,,it,doesn't,have,per-user,separation,,but,it's,OK,because,it,would,only,serve,the,convenience,function,of,pre-filling,the,fields,in,a,dialog.,You'd,still,have,to,press,Send.,We'd,have,to,make,sure,the,Send,button,is,not,selected,so,it,couldn't,jump,into,the,foreground,while,you're,typing,a,space,or,enter.

Does,it,happen,every,time,you,run,it,,or,just,happened,once,at,some,random,time?

I've,never,seen,that,fail,before.,It's,a,call,to,OpenSSL,that,I,assumed,would,never,fail,,but,I,put,an,error,check,there,just,in,case.,I,can't,imagine,how,it,would,fail.,Out,of,memory,maybe.

Does,it,happen,every,time,you,run,it,,or,just,happened,once,at,some,random,time?

I've,never,seen,that,fail,before.,It's,a,call,to,OpenSSL,that,I,assumed,would,never,fail,,but,I,put,an,error,check,there,just,in,case.,I,can't,imagine,how,it,would,fail.,Out,of,memory,maybe.

It's,not,the,download,so,much,as,verifying,all,the,signatures,in,all,the,blocks,as,it,downloads,that,takes,a,long,time.

How,long,is,the,initial,block,download,typically,taking?,Does,it,slow,down,half,way,through,or,is,about,the,same,speed,the,whole,way?

I've,thought,about,ways,to,do,a,more,cursory,check,of,most,of,the,chain,up,to,the,last,few,thousand,blocks.,It,is,possible,,but,it's,a,lot,of,work,,and,there,are,a,lot,of,other,higher,priority,things,to,work,on.

Simplified,Payment,Verification,is,for,lightweight,client-only,users,who,only,do,transactions,and,don't,generate,and,don't,participate,in,the,node,network.,They,wouldn't,need,to,download,blocks,,just,the,hash,chain,,which,is,currently,about,2MB,and,very,quick,to,verify,(less,than,a,second,to,verify,the,whole,chain).,If,the,network,becomes,very,large,,like,over,100,000,nodes,,this,is,what,we'll,use,to,allow,common,users,to,do,transactions,without,being,full,blown,nodes.,At,that,stage,,most,users,should,start,running,client-only,software,and,only,the,specialist,server,farms,keep,running,full,network,nodes,,kind,of,like,how,the,usenet,network,has,consolidated.

SPV,is,not,implemented,yet,,and,won't,be,implemented,until,far,in,the,future,,but,all,the,current,implementation,is,designed,around,supporting,it.

In,the,meantime,,sites,like,vekja.net,and,www.mybitcoin.com,have,been,experimenting,with,account-based,sites.,You,create,an,account,on,a,website,and,hold,your,bitcoins,on,account,there,and,transfer,in,and,out.,Creating,an,account,on,a,website,is,a,lot,easier,than,installing,and,learning,to,use,software,,and,a,more,familiar,way,of,doing,it,for,most,people.,The,only,disadvantage,is,that,you,have,to,trust,the,site,,but,that's,fine,for,pocket,change,amounts,for,micropayments,and,misc,expenses.,It's,an,easy,way,to,get,started,and,if,you,get,larger,amounts,then,you,can,upgrade,to,the,actual,bitcoin,software.

Almost,but,not,quite.,Bitcoin,uses,EC-DSA,,which,can,only,do,digital,signing,,not,encryption.,RSA,can,do,both,,but,I,didn't,use,it,because,it's,an,order,of,magnitude,bigger,and,would,have,been,impractical.

If,you're,just,getting,one,particular,user's,balance,,such,as,in,response,to,a,page,request,by,that,user,,use,getreceivedbylabel,,but,if,you're,scanning,over,all,users,,it's,better,to,use,listreceivedbylabel,to,get,the,complete,list,and,scan,against,the,result.,Scanning,users,with,getreceivedbylabel,would,be,n-squared,,using,listreceivedbylabel,is,n-log-n,(or,n,linear).

You,should,only,really,need,to,scan,all,users,if,you're,polling,in,order,to,spontaneously,take,action,in,response,to,money,received,,rather,than,the,user,going,to,a,webpage,,seeing,their,balance,and,telling,you,what,to,do,with,it.,It's,not,necessary,to,poll,very,frequently.,If,you,require,1,confirmation,,that'll,take,an,average,of,10,minutes,anyway,,so,there's,no,point,in,polling,more,often,than,every,few,minutes.

If,you're,selling,digital,goods,and,services,,where,you,don't,lose,much,if,someone,gets,a,free,access,,and,it,can't,be,resold,for,profit,,I,think,you're,fine,to,accept,0,confirmations.

It's,mostly,only,if,you,were,selling,gold,or,currency,that,you'd,need,multiple,confirmations.

It,does,in,fact,download,500,blocks,at,a,time,,then,the,counter,counts,one,at,a,time,as,it,verifies,the,blocks.

The,advantage,of,letting,bitcoin,download,and,verify,the,blocks,is,that,you,do,not,have,to,trust,the,person,you're,downloading,them,from.,If,you,downloaded,the,blk*.dat,files,from,some,site,,you,would,have,to,trust,that,site,,since,you,would,be,accepting,the,data,without,verifying,it,yourself.,If,you're,copying,blk*.dat,from,another,computer,of,yours,,that,should,be,fine.

How,long,is,the,initial,block,download,taking,for,you?

I,uploaded,the,93%,complete,Dutch,translation,to,SVN.,Thanks!

Bitcoin,has,its,own,distributed,address,directory,using,the,"addr",message.,It's,about,time,we,coded,in,a,list,of,the,current,long,running,static,nodes,to,seed,from.,I,can,add,code,so,new,nodes,do,not,preferentially,stay,connected,to,the,seed,nodes,,just,connect,and,get,the,list,,so,it,won't,be,a,burden,on,them.

What,do,you,think,,should,I,go,ahead,with,adding,the,seeds?

It'll,still,try,IRC,first.,The,IRC,has,the,advantage,that,it,lists,nodes,that,are,currently,online,,since,they,have,to,stay,connected,to,stay,on,the,list,,but,the,disadvantage,that,it's,a,single,point,of,failure.,The,"addr",system,has,no,single,point,of,failure,,but,can,only,tell,you,what,nodes,have,recently,been,seen,,so,it,takes,a,little,longer,to,get,connected,since,some,of,the,nodes,you,try,have,gone,offline.,The,combination,of,the,two,gets,us,the,best,of,both,worlds,and,more,total,robustness.

Is,there,anyone,who,wants,to,volunteer,to,run,an,IRC,server,in,case,freenode,gets,tired,of,us?

SirArthur,has,a,good,point,about,the,normal,online,merchant,case,,which,is,what,the,send-by-IP,option,is,more,suited,to.,This,is,the,case,where,the,merchant,will,have,a,server,on,a,static,IP,and,their,own,domain,name,and,SSL,cert.

Instead,of,connecting,by,IP,,we,can,connect,to,a,domain,name,by,SSL,,using,the,existing,CA,infrastructure,to,authenticate,that,you're,connected,to,the,owner,of,that,domain.

The,user,would,send,to,domain.com,(or,www.domain.com,is,ok,too).,That,would,be,very,natural,and,users,could,see,and,verify,that,what,they,entered,is,who,they,intend,to,pay.

The,SSL,also,makes,it,safe,for,TOR,users.

Problem,is,,I,think,merchants,would,still,prefer,to,use,bitcoin,addresses,to,be,certain,they,know,what,the,payment,is,for.,You,simply,cannot,count,on,users,to,enter,the,right,thing,in,the,comment,fields,to,identify,the,transaction.,It,would,only,approach,practical,if,we,had,a,mailto,style,link,that,prepopulates,the,comment,field,with,the,order,number,,but,then,the,link,could,just,as,well,be,a,bitcoin,address.

Just,having,an,open,bitcoin,server,at,domain.com,that,users,could,send,unidentified,payments,to,would,be,too,much,of,a,liability.,Regular,users,aren't,used,to,the,idea,of,having,to,identify,the,payment.,Merchants,would,get,too,many,blank,payments,followed,by,"I,paid,you,,where's,my,stuff?!",a,week,later.

The,payment,sequence,does,have,a,step,where,the,receiver,verifies,the,order,before,accepting,it.,It,can,reject,the,payment,and,return,an,error,message,if,it,doesn't,contain,a,valid,order,number.,That,would,require,a,difficult,level,of,integration,of,custom,code,with,the,bitcoin,server,though.

SHA-256,is,very,strong.,It's,not,like,the,incremental,step,from,MD5,to,SHA1.,It,can,last,several,decades,unless,there's,some,massive,breakthrough,attack.

If,SHA-256,became,completely,broken,,I,think,we,could,come,to,some,agreement,about,what,the,honest,block,chain,was,before,the,trouble,started,,lock,that,in,and,continue,from,there,with,a,new,hash,function.

If,the,hash,breakdown,came,gradually,,we,could,transition,to,a,new,hash,in,an,orderly,way.,The,software,would,be,programmed,to,start,using,a,new,hash,after,a,certain,block,number.,Everyone,would,have,to,upgrade,by,that,time.,The,software,could,save,the,new,hash,of,all,the,old,blocks,to,make,sure,a,different,block,with,the,same,old,hash,can't,be,used.

The,premise,is,false.,Adding,more,transactions,to,the,block,you're,working,on,does,NOT,slow,down,your,generation,rate.,When,generate,is,scanning,hashes,,it,only,hashes,the,header,of,the,block,,which,is,constant,size.,The,header,contains,a,hash,of,the,transactions,(the,Merkle,root),and,is,only,updated,occasionally.

If,necessary,I,can,write,code,to,make,nodes,prefer,not,to,use,a,block,if,it,doesn't,contain,enough,of,the,transactions,they,know,about.,A,discouraged,block,would,almost,always,fail,to,be,included,in,the,main,chain,,but,would,be,accepted,if,it,did,get,in.,I,doubt,this,will,be,necessary,,since,there's,no,real,advantage,for,nodes,not,to,include,all,transactions.

Thanks,DataWraith!,The,German,translation,is,uploaded,to,SVN.

This,is,great,,we've,already,got,3,major,languages.

I'm,working,on,getting,version,0.3,released,as,soon,as,I,can.,Just,a,last,few,things,left,to,do.,It's,been,a,long,time,since,0.2,and,we,need,to,get,a,prebuilt,bitcoind,with,command,line,and,JSON-RPC,available.,This,time,we'll,have,both,32-bit,and,64-bit,linux,binaries,,and,Laszlo,is,going,to,build,a,Mac,OSX,release.,Plus,,we'll,include,the,German,,Dutch,and,Italian,translations,by,DataWraith,,Xunie,and,Joozero,(thanks,you,guys!).

The,nature,of,Bitcoin,is,such,that,once,version,0.1,was,released,,the,core,design,was,set,in,stone,for,the,rest,of,its,lifetime.,Because,of,that,,I,wanted,to,design,it,to,support,every,possible,transaction,type,I,could,think,of.,The,problem,was,,each,thing,required,special,support,code,and,data,fields,whether,it,was,used,or,not,,and,only,covered,one,special,case,at,a,time.,It,would,have,been,an,explosion,of,special,cases.,The,solution,was,script,,which,generalizes,the,problem,so,transacting,parties,can,describe,their,transaction,as,a,predicate,that,the,node,network,evaluates.,The,nodes,only,need,to,understand,the,transaction,to,the,extent,of,evaluating,whether,the,sender's,conditions,are,met.

The,script,is,actually,a,predicate.,It's,just,an,equation,that,evaluates,to,true,or,false.,Predicate,is,a,long,and,unfamiliar,word,so,I,called,it,script.

The,receiver,of,a,payment,does,a,template,match,on,the,script.,Currently,,receivers,only,accept,two,templates:,direct,payment,and,bitcoin,address.,Future,versions,can,add,templates,for,more,transaction,types,and,nodes,running,that,version,or,higher,will,be,able,to,receive,them.,All,versions,of,nodes,in,the,network,can,verify,and,process,any,new,transactions,into,blocks,,even,though,they,may,not,know,how,to,read,them.

The,design,supports,a,tremendous,variety,of,possible,transaction,types,that,I,designed,years,ago.,Escrow,transactions,,bonded,contracts,,third,party,arbitration,,multi-party,signature,,etc.,If,Bitcoin,catches,on,in,a,big,way,,these,are,things,we'll,want,to,explore,in,the,future,,but,they,all,had,to,be,designed,at,the,beginning,to,make,sure,they,would,be,possible,later.

I,don't,believe,a,second,,compatible,implementation,of,Bitcoin,will,ever,be,a,good,idea.,So,much,of,the,design,depends,on,all,nodes,getting,exactly,identical,results,in,lockstep,that,a,second,implementation,would,be,a,menace,to,the,network.,The,MIT,license,is,compatible,with,all,other,licenses,and,commercial,uses,,so,there,is,no,need,to,rewrite,it,from,a,licensing,standpoint.

A,second,version,would,be,a,massive,development,and,maintenance,hassle,for,me.,It's,hard,enough,maintaining,backward,compatibility,while,upgrading,the,network,without,a,second,version,locking,things,in.,If,the,second,version,screwed,up,,the,user,experience,would,reflect,badly,on,both,,although,it,would,at,least,reinforce,to,users,the,importance,of,staying,with,the,official,version.,If,someone,was,getting,ready,to,fork,a,second,version,,I,would,have,to,air,a,lot,of,disclaimers,about,the,risks,of,using,a,minority,version.,This,is,a,design,where,the,majority,version,wins,if,there's,any,disagreement,,and,that,can,be,pretty,ugly,for,the,minority,version,and,I'd,rather,not,go,into,it,,and,I,don't,have,to,as,long,as,there's,only,one,version.

I,know,,most,developers,don't,like,their,software,forked,,but,I,have,real,technical,reasons,in,this,case.

That's,one,of,the,reasons,for,transaction,fees.,There,are,other,things,we,can,do,if,necessary.

Since,2007.,At,some,point,I,became,convinced,there,was,a,way,to,do,this,without,any,trust,required,at,all,and,couldn't,resist,to,keep,thinking,about,it.,Much,more,of,the,work,was,designing,than,coding.

Fortunately,,so,far,all,the,issues,raised,have,been,things,I,previously,considered,and,planned,for.

The,SVN,version,now,uses,IRC,first,and,if,that,fails,it,falls,back,to,a,hardcoded,list,of,seed,nodes.,There,are,enough,seed,nodes,now,that,many,of,them,should,still,be,up,by,the,time,of,the,next,release.,It,only,briefly,connects,to,a,seed,node,to,get,the,address,list,and,then,disconnects,,so,your,connections,drop,back,to,zero,for,while.,At,that,point,,be,patient.,It's,only,slow,to,get,connected,the,first,time.

This,means,TOR,users,won't,need,to,-addnode,anymore,,it'll,get,connected,automatically.,

Excellent,choice,of,a,first,project,,nice,work.,I,had,planned,to,do,this,exact,thing,if,someone,else,didn't,do,it,,so,when,it,gets,too,hard,for,mortals,to,generate,50BTC,,new,users,could,get,some,coins,to,play,with,right,away.,Donations,should,be,able,to,keep,it,filled.,The,display,showing,the,balance,in,the,dispenser,encourages,people,to,top,it,up.

You,should,put,a,donation,bitcoin,address,on,the,page,for,those,who,want,to,add,funds,to,it,,which,ideally,should,update,to,a,new,address,whenever,it,receives,something.

Computers,have,to,get,about,2^200,times,faster,before,that,starts,to,be,a,problem.,Someone,with,lots,of,compute,power,could,make,more,money,by,generating,than,by,trying,to,steal.

But,now,that,you,mention,it,,it's,probably,better,to,have,the,feature,,even,if,it's,messy,,than,not,to,have,it,,though,it,may,confuse,a,few,people,when,the,taskbar,button,temporarily,stays,around,but,disappears,if,you,click,on,it.

Updated,SVN.

Thanks,for,testing

I,finished,everything,on,my,list,to,do,for,version,0.3.,The,code,on,SVN,is,about,ready,to,release.

Testing,at,this,point,is,much,appreciated.

I've,noticed,that,hashing,performance,doesn't,vary,as,much,between,CPUs,as,you'd,expect.,Compared,to,an,old,CPU,,a,newer,CPU,doesn't,show,as,much,of,a,speedup,at,hashing,as,it,does,on,general,benchmarks.

I,guess,recent,CPU,optimizations,must,have,concentrated,on,things,like,I/O,and,branch,prediction.,Most,programs,are,a,bunch,of,memory,access,,comparisons,and,branching,,they,rarely,get,down,to,cranking,away,at,maths,for,very,long.

The,latest,SVN,version,has,a,khash/s,display.,Around,400,khash/s,per,processor,is,typical.

It's,too,late,now,for,feature,changes,to,0.3,,but,I'll,add,that,to,the,post-0.3,to,do,list.,I,never,would,have,noticed,that,if,you,hadn't,pointed,it,out.

Agree.,Certainly,too,trivial,to,clutter,the,user's,attention,with.

I,changed,it,to,every,30,minutes.

If,I,increased,it,to,every,10,minutes,,it,would,still,be,a,small,enough,presence,in,the,log,file.,Question,is,whether,that,would,be,more,output,than,the,user,wants,when,they,grep.

My,fear,is,too,many,programmers,would,latch,onto,that,for,checking,for,received,payments.,It,can,never,be,reliable,that,way.,The,list/getreceivedbyaddress/label,functions,are,the,only,way,to,do,it,reliably.

We,shouldn't,delay,forever,until,every,possible,feature,is,done.,There's,always,going,to,be,one,more,thing,to,do.

What,operating,system?

Normally,when,it,does,that,it's,because,the,directory,where,the,data,directory,should,go,doesn't,exist.,See,if,the,"%appdata%",directory,exists.

Do,you,get,that,error,with,0.2,also?,It's,hard,to,see,how,you,could,get,that,with,0.3,and,not,with,0.2,since,there's,nothing,different,in,that,regard.

Laszlo,figured,out,that,enabling,some,more,optimisation,increased,performance,about,20%,,so,0.3,hashes,20%,faster,than,0.2.0,,but,I,assume,he,used,that,in,his,own,build.

Thanks,virtualcoin,,that's,a,perfect,comparison.

The,8%,speedup,from,32-bit,Windows,(2310k),to,32-bit,Linux,(2500k),is,probably,from,the,newer,version,of,GCC,on,Linux,(4.4.3,vs,3.4.5).

The,15%,speedup,from,32-bit,to,64-bit,Linux,is,more,of,a,mystery.,The,code,is,completely,32-bit.

Hmm,,I,think,the,8,extra,registers,added,by,x86-64,must,be,what's,helping.,That,would,make,a,significant,difference,to,SHA,if,it,could,hold,most,of,the,16,state,variables,in,registers.

This,seems,like,a,good,idea.

What,does,everyone,think,,should,we,make,the,switch,for,0.3?

The,first,panel,of,the,status,bar,is,shared,with,the,help,description,of,menu,items,as,you,hover,over,them.,Since,all,our,menu,item,descriptions,are,blank,,it,replaces,it,with,blank,when,you're,hovering,in,a,menu.

Is,it,about,time,we,lose,the,Beta?,I,would,make,this,release,version,1.3.

I,think,that's,the,best,option,right,now.,Like,cash,,you,don't,keep,your,entire,net,worth,in,your,pocket,,just,walking,around,money,for,incidental,expenses.

They,could,make,a,smaller,version,of,the,site,optimized,for,mobile.,If,there,was,an,app,,it,could,be,a,front,end,to,one,of,those,,with,the,main,feature,being,QR-code,reader,,or,maybe,there's,already,a,universal,QR-code,reading,app,that,web,sites,can,be,designed,to,accept,scans,from.

If,there,was,an,iPhone,app,that,was,just,a,front,end,for,vekja,or,mybitcoin,,not,a,big,involved,P2P,,would,apple,approve,it,and,if,not,,on,what,basis?,It,could,always,be,an,Android,app,instead.,An,app,is,not,really,necessary,though,,just,a,mobile,sized,website.

A,web,interface,to,your,own,Bitcoin,server,at,home,wouldn't,be,a,solution,for,everyone.,Most,users,don't,have,a,static,IP,,and,it's,too,much,trouble,to,set,up,port,forwarding.

Many,big,ISPs,give,you,a,new,IP,every,time,you,connect,,usually,in,the,same,class,B,(a.b.?.?).,Maybe,you,should,have,a,minimum,time,between,payments,per,class-B.

If,you,can't,solve,the,problem,,you,can,always,keep,lowering,the,amount,of,bitcoins,given,until,it's,manageable,,and,always,require,captcha.

But,1.0,sounds,like,the,first,release.,For,some,things,newness,is,a,virtue,but,for,this,type,of,software,,maturity,and,stability,are,important.,I,don't,want,to,put,my,money,in,something,that's,1.0.,1.0,might,be,more,interesting,for,a,moment,,but,after,that,we're,still,1.0,and,everyone,who,comes,along,thinks,we,just,started.,This,is,the,third,major,release,and,1.3,reflects,that,development,history.,(0.1,,0.2,,1.3)

Welcome,,Harry.

I,hadn't,thought,about,starting,out,using,bitcoind,without,using,bitcoin,first.,I,guess,for,now,,this,thread,serves,as,the,tutorial.,

The,focus,for,bitcoind,so,far,has,been,more,on,backend,support,for,websites.,There's,demand,for,things,that,would,be,nice,for,adminning,headless,generators,like,listgenerated.,For,the,moment,,you,can,grep,the,debug.log,file,for,"generated",and,"hashmeter",for,some,feedback.,Generated,blocks,take,about,24,hours,before,they're,credited,to,your,balance.

MinGW,still,only,has,good,old,stable,3.4.5.,There's,not,much,reason,for,them,to,update,it.

When,I,looked,at,the,3.4.5,compiled,SHA,disassembly,,I,couldn't,see,any,room,for,improvement,at,all.,I,can't,imagine,how,8%,more,could,be,squeezed,out,of,it.,Is,it,possible,Windows,could,have,8%,more,overhead?,Not,making,system,calls,or,anything,,just,plain,busy,computational,code,,could,task,switching,and,other,housekeeping,operations,take,away,that,much?

Thanks,for,the,feedback,on,this.

One,thing,we,could,do,is,lower,the,outbound,connections,from,15,to,10,or,maybe,even,5.,The,choice,of,15,was,arbitrary.,It,just,needs,to,be,enough,for,redundancy,and,fast,exponential,propagation,of,messages.,10,would,still,be,plenty.,5,should,be,fine.,10,is,good,as,a,nice,round,number,so,users,can,see,that,it,stopped,intentionally.

It,would,help,to,implement,UPnP,so,there,would,be,more,inbound,accepting,nodes.,Your,number,of,connections,is,the,ratio,of,inbound,accepting,nodes,to,out-only,times,15.,We,need,to,encourage,more,people,to,accept,inbound,connections.

I,will,implement,a,feature,to,stop,accepting,inbound,connections,once,you,hit,a,certain,number.

Which,version,are,you,running?

Anyone,know,how,many,connections,typical,P2P,software,like,BitTorrent,can,get,up,to?

It,is,,but,generating,is,more,than,twice,as,slow.

Other,than,the,version,number,change,,which,included,changes,in,readme.txt,and,setup.nsi,,I,reduced,the,maximum,number,of,outbound,connections,from,15,to,8,so,nodes,that,accept,inbound,don't,get,too,many,connections.,15,was,a,lot,more,than,needed.,8,is,still,plenty,for,redundancy.

I,reduced,max,outbound,connections,from,15,to,8,in,RC4.

15,was,way,more,than,we,needed,for,redundancy.,8,is,still,plenty,of,redundancy.

As,the,nodes,upgrade,to,this,version,,this,will,cut,in,half,the,number,of,connections,that,inbound,accepting,nodes,get.

If,anyone,wants,more,than,8,connections,,they,can,open,port,8333,on,their,firewall.

Laszlo's,build,is,going,to,be,our,first,Mac,release,so,please,test,it!

BTW,,I,did,come,to,my,senses,after,that,brief,bout,with,1.3,,this,release,is,still,going,to,be,0.3,beta,not,1.0.

I,really,appreciate,the,effort,,but,there,are,a,lot,of,problems.

We,don't,want,to,lead,with,"anonymous".,(I've,been,meaning,to,edit,the,homepage)

"The,developers,expect,that,this,will,result,in,a,stable-with-respect-to-energy,currency,outside,the,reach,of,any,government.",--,I,am,definitely,not,making,an,such,taunt,or,assertion.

It's,not,stable-with-respect-to-energy.,There,was,a,discussion,on,this.,It's,not,tied,to,the,cost,of,energy.,NLS's,estimate,based,on,energy,was,a,good,estimated,starting,point,,but,market,forces,will,increasingly,dominate.

Sorry,to,be,a,wet,blanket.,Writing,a,description,for,this,thing,for,general,audiences,is,bloody,hard.,There's,nothing,to,relate,it,to.

Announcing,version,0.3,of,Bitcoin,,the,P2P,cryptocurrency!,Bitcoin,is,a,digital,currency,using,cryptography,and,a,distributed,network,to,replace,the,need,for,a,trusted,central,server.,Escape,the,arbitrary,inflation,risk,of,centrally,managed,currencies!,Bitcoin's,total,circulation,is,limited,to,21,million,coins.,The,coins,are,gradually,released,to,the,network's,nodes,based,on,the,CPU,power,they,contribute,,so,you,can,get,a,share,of,them,by,contributing,your,idle,CPU,time.

It,might,not,be,good,if,we,suddenly,rushed,freenode,with,a,ton,of,users,all,at,once.

The,fallback,is,our,own,seed,system.

irc.lfnet.org,is,pretty,old,and,has,impressive,uptime.,I,think,it's,going,to,be,fine.

We,could,take,IRC,out,at,some,point,if,we,want,,but,I'd,rather,ease,into,it,and,just,test,our,own,seed,system,as,a,backup,for,now,,and,I,really,like,the,complementary,redundant,attributes,of,the,two,different,systems.

It's,hard,to,imagine,the,Internet,getting,segmented,airtight.,It,would,have,to,be,a,country,deliberately,and,totally,cutting,itself,off,from,the,rest,of,the,world.

Any,node,with,access,to,both,sides,would,automatically,flow,the,block,chain,over,,such,as,someone,getting,around,the,blockade,with,a,dial-up,modem,or,sat-phone.,It,would,only,take,one,node,to,do,it.,Anyone,who,wants,to,keep,doing,business,would,be,motivated.

If,the,network,is,segmented,and,then,recombines,,any,transactions,in,the,shorter,fork,that,were,not,also,in,the,longer,fork,are,released,into,the,transaction,pool,again,and,are,eligible,to,get,into,future,blocks.,Their,number,of,confirmations,would,start,over.

If,anyone,took,advantage,of,the,segmentation,to,double-spend,,such,that,there,are,different,spends,of,the,same,money,on,each,side,,then,the,double-spends,in,the,shorter,fork,lose,out,and,go,to,0/unconfirmed,and,stay,that,way.

It,wouldn't,be,easy,to,take,advantage,of,the,segmentation,to,double-spend.,If,it's,impossible,to,communicate,from,one,side,to,the,other,,how,are,you,going,to,put,a,spend,on,each,side?,If,there,is,a,way,,then,probably,someone,else,is,also,using,it,to,flow,the,block,chain,over.

You,would,usually,know,whether,you're,in,the,smaller,segment.,For,example,,if,your,country,cuts,itself,off,from,the,rest,of,the,world,,the,rest,of,the,world,is,the,larger,segment.,If,you're,in,the,smaller,segment,,you,should,assume,nothing,is,confirmed.

I,think,I,see,where,the,problem,is.,Coincidentally,,I,recently,coded,a,replacement,for,the,function,in,question,which,should,fix,it.,It's,not,enabled,yet,,but,in,the,SVN,version,it,prints,a,debug,message,in,debug.log,showing,the,new,directory,value,and,old,value,for,comparison.

What,the,OP,described,is,called,"cornering,the,market".,When,someone,tries,to,buy,all,the,world's,supply,of,a,scarce,asset,,the,more,they,buy,the,higher,the,price,goes.,At,some,point,,it,gets,too,expensive,for,them,to,buy,any,more.,It's,great,for,the,people,who,owned,it,beforehand,because,they,get,to,sell,it,to,the,corner,at,crazy,high,prices.,As,the,price,keeps,going,up,and,up,,some,people,keep,holding,out,for,yet,higher,prices,and,refuse,to,sell.

True,,if,it,happened,suddenly.,If,it,happens,gradually,,we,can,still,transition,to,something,stronger.,When,you,run,the,upgraded,software,for,the,first,time,,it,would,re-sign,all,your,money,with,the,new,stronger,signature,algorithm.,(by,creating,a,transaction,sending,the,money,to,yourself,with,the,stronger,sig)

Thanks,for,making,that,calculator.

The,difficulty,doubled,a,day,or,two,ago,,plus,it's,just,random,and,you,can,have,surprisingly,long,dry,spells.

Laszlo,corrected,this,,but,unfortunately,it,was,too,late,to,make,it,into,0.3.0.,There,will,probably,be,a,0.3.1,soon,though.

The,problem,is,I,used,PRIO_MIN,,I,should,have,used,PRIO_MAX,for,the,lowest,priority.,The,OS,isn't,supposed,to,let,you,increase,priority,,so,the,PRIO_MIN,ought,to,leave,it,at,priority,0.

This,is,the,second,time,I've,seen,this,"Live,Protection",problem,reported.

It,must,be,blocking,the,program's,network,communication.,It,sounds,like,it's,allowing,connections,to,be,made,,hence,the,10,connections,shown,,but,not,allowing,any,data,to,be,sent,or,received,on,them.

We,need,to,understand,this,problem,better.

Can,someone,write,some,instructions,on,the,wiki,explaining,how,to,turn,off,or,add,an,exclusion,to,Live,Protection,or,whatever,its,full,proper,name,is.

What,language,is,your,computer,set,to?,Is,it,set,to,German,,Dutch,or,Italian?,Is,it,one,of,those,sub-languages,like,"nl-??"?

It's,trying,to,load,a,translation,and,failing.,You,could,delete,the,locale,directory,that,came,with,bitcoin,so,it,doesn't,try,to,use,it.

Can,someone,test,each,language,on,Ubuntu,and,see,if,there's,a,problem,with,just,one,of,them,or,maybe,all,three?

After,it,initially,tries,incorrectly,to,set,itself,to,the,lowest,priority,,the,generate,thread,only,changes,its,priority,again,temporarily,when,it,finds,a,block.,When,you've,found,a,block,,you,should,want,it,to,hurry,up,and,broadcast,it,as,soon,a,possible,before,someone,else,finds,one,and,makes,yours,invalid.,The,generate,thread,only,changes,to,higher,priority,for,less,than,a,second,every,few,days.

There,should,be,a,0.3.1,release,for,this,soon.,There,are,a,few,other,issues,we,need,to,look,at,fixing,in,0.3.1,before,making,a,release.

That's,interesting.,I,know,the,minimize,to,tray,on,Ubuntu,is,very,clunky,,but,I,didn't,know,it,had,a,CPU,peg,problem,too.,Anyone,else,able,to,reproduce,this,problem?,We,had,this,feature,disabled,on,Linux,before,,but,then,it,seemed,better,to,have,the,imperfect,UI,than,to,lose,the,feature,entirely.,I'm,thinking,we,should,disable,it,again,on,Linux.

Microsoft,Security,Essentials,Live,Protection,is,blocking,your,communication,with,the,network.,You,have,connections,,which,tricks,Bitcoin,into,thinking,it's,connected,,but,they,are,silent,because,the,data,is,being,blocked.

You,need,to,make,bitcoin.exe,an,excluded,process,in,Live,Protection.

This,is,becoming,a,common,problem.,Someone,should,write,this,up,in,a,pegged,thread.

The,message,"Warning:,This,block,was,not,received,by,any,other,nodes",occurs,when,Bitcoin,broadcasts,a,block,,but,nobody,confirms,they,received,it.,The,warning,is,there,just,for,this,kind,of,situation,,where,for,some,reason,you,have,connections,,but,they,have,gone,dead,and,nobody,can,hear,you.,Your,block,will,never,become,valid,because,nobody,received,it.

This,is,a,common,point,of,confusion.,There's,no,such,thing,as,being,1%,towards,solving,a,block.,You,don't,make,progress,towards,solving,it.,After,working,on,it,for,24,hours,,your,chances,of,solving,it,are,equal,to,what,your,chances,were,at,the,start,or,at,any,moment.

It's,like,trying,to,flip,37,coins,at,once,and,have,them,all,come,up,heads.,Each,time,you,try,,your,chances,of,success,are,the,same.

The,RNG,is,the,OpenSSL,secure,random,number,generator.,On,Windows,it's,seeded,with,the,complete,set,of,all,hardware,performance,counters,since,your,computer,started,,on,Linux,it's,dev/random.

The,design,outlines,a,lightweight,client,that,does,not,need,the,full,block,chain.,In,the,design,PDF,it's,called,Simplified,Payment,Verification.,The,lightweight,client,can,send,and,receive,transactions,,it,just,can't,generate,blocks.,It,does,not,need,to,trust,a,node,to,verify,payments,,it,can,still,verify,them,itself.

The,lightweight,client,is,not,implemented,yet,,but,the,plan,is,to,implement,it,when,it's,needed.,For,now,,everyone,just,runs,a,full,network,node.

I,anticipate,there,will,never,be,more,than,100K,nodes,,probably,less.,It,will,reach,an,equilibrium,where,it's,not,worth,it,for,more,nodes,to,join,in.,The,rest,will,be,lightweight,clients,,which,could,be,millions.

At,equilibrium,size,,many,nodes,will,be,server,farms,with,one,or,two,network,nodes,that,feed,the,rest,of,the,farm,over,a,LAN.

Then,all,the,CPU,time,is,the,generate,thread,,which,definitely,runs,at,the,lowest,possible,priority,,idle,priority.,It's,normal,that,your,CPU,meter,is,100%.,Since,it's,idle,priority,,it,won't,actually,slow,anything,else,down,,even,though,the,CPU,meter,is,100%.

Well,,it,can't,hurt,to,do,a,backup,and,it's,a,good,idea,to,backup,regularly,,but,no,,a,backup,is,not,required,before,installing,this.

I,don't,think,you,have,a,particular,problem,,I,think,your,system,is,laggy,because,you're,running,a,lot,of,things,at,once,and,hitting,the,pagefile,because,memory,is,full.,You,confirmed,when,you,shut,off,generation,that,your,CPU,drops,to,0%,,so,the,CPU,usage,is,definitely,all,idle,priority.,There's,nothing,in,the,0.3.1,that,would,affect,these,things.

Yes,a,bug.,It'll,have,to,be,fixed,in,the,next,version.

I,have,to,guess,it,has,something,to,do,with,your,display,color,depth,selection.,e.g.,8-bit,,16-bit,,24-bit,,32-bit,,what,is,it?,Do,you,have,a,weird,video,card,,display,setup,or,running,it,on,a,tablet,or,mobile,or,something?

It,could,go,either,way.,The,Startup,folder,has,the,advantage,that,the,end,user,can,see,it,and,manually,remove,it,with,the,regular,UI,(not,regedit),if,they,already,blew,away,the,Bitcoin,directory,and,its,uninstaller.,Bitcoin,will,not,relentlessly,keep,re-adding,it,if,you,delete,it,manually.

OpenOffice,is,another,example,of,something,that,puts,its,link,in,the,Startup,folder.

What,is,"120DPI,mode"?,Is,that,an,actual,setting,somewhere?,Sounds,like,an,obscure,enough,candidate.,I,suppose,it,needs,twice,the,resolution,icon,to,fill,the,size,of,the,upper,left,corner,icon.,Only,one,size,is,provided.

5,BTC,seems,like,a,lot,these,days,,maybe,the,normal,amount,should,be,1,or,2,BTC.

This,is,an,important,service,so,new,users,can,at,least,get,something,if,generating,is,too,hard.

It's,about,to,increase,again,in,a,few,hours.,It's,only,been,3-4,days,since,the,last,increase,,so,I,expect,it,will,increase,by,the,max,of,4,times,,or,very,nearly,the,max.,That,would,put,it,at,181.54.

The,target,time,between,adjustments,is,14,days,,14/3.5,days,=,4.0,times,increase.

Bitcoin,automatically,rebroadcasts,your,transactions,if,it,receives,new,blocks,that,don't,contain,them.,It,may,take,about,an,hour,to,get,rebroadcasted.,It,is,relentless,though.,It,will,keep,nagging,the,network,forever,until,your,transaction,gets,into,a,block.

Because,of,all,the,dependencies,that,different,systems,don't,have.,It's,easier,to,just,static,link,what,we,can.,It,doesn't,increase,the,size,by,very,much.

I,like,that,in,libraries,for,the,external,API's,,but,you,can,probably,tell,from,the,code,that,I'm,not,a,fan,of,it,for,interior,functions.,Big,obligatory,comment,headers,for,each,function,space,out,the,code,and,make,you,hesitate,about,creating,a,small,little,function,where,the,comment,header,would,be,bigger,than,the,function.,They're,some,trouble,for,maintenance,,as,changes,to,the,function,then,require,duplicate,changes,in,the,comment,header.,I,like,to,keep,code,compact,so,you,can,see,more,code,on,the,screen,at,once.

To,add,them,now,at,this,point,,what,would,be,written,would,just,be,what's,obvious,from,looking,at,the,function.

The,external,API,we,have,,in,rpc.cpp,,the,usage,documentation,is,in,the,help,string.

Sorry,to,be,a,wet,blanket.


To,use,an,analogy,,it's,more,like,the,step,from,32-bit,to,64-bit,address,space.,We,quickly,ran,out,of,address,space,with,16-bit,computers,,we,ran,out,of,address,space,with,32-bit,computers,at,4GB,,that,doesn't,mean,we're,going,to,run,out,again,with,64-bit,anytime,soon.

SHA256,is,not,going,to,be,broken,by,Moore's,law,computational,improvements,in,our,lifetimes.,If,it's,going,to,get,broken,,it'll,be,by,some,breakthrough,cracking,method.,An,attack,that,could,so,thoroughly,vanquish,SHA256,to,bring,it,within,computationally,tractable,range,has,a,good,chance,of,clobbering,SHA512,too.

If,we,see,a,weakness,in,SHA256,coming,gradually,,we,can,transition,to,a,new,hash,function,after,a,certain,block,number.,Everyone,would,have,to,upgrade,their,software,by,that,block,number.,The,new,software,would,keep,a,new,hash,of,all,the,old,blocks,to,make,sure,they're,not,replaced,with,another,block,with,the,same,old,hash.

Many,businesses,are,like,that.,For,a,car,salesman,,when,will,the,next,customer,walk,in,the,door?

On,the,OP's,question,,it's,a,good,feature,,but,the,question,is,,how,would,we,word,it,so,people,don't,expect,to,get,something,after,that,specific,amount,of,time?,"it,said,7,days,and,I,waited,more,than,a,week,and,didn't,get,anything!",Approx,,average,,but,still,they're,going,to,think,that,way.,It,can't,be,a,whole,sentence,,unless,we,think,of,somewhere,else,to,put,it,,but,where,would,that,be?,Suggestions?

The,difficulty,quadrupled,a,few,minutes,ago,to,181.54.,It's,going,to,take,typically,about,a,week,to,generate,now.

It,adjusted,to,181.54,a,few,minutes,ago.,Typical,time,to,get,a,block,is,about,a,week,now.

The,difficulty,can,adjust,down,as,well,as,up.

The,network,should,be,generating,close,to,6,blocks,per,hour,now.

It's,in,init.cpp.

It's,a,wxWidgets,app,,so,it,doesn't,have,a,main(),function.,It,may,in,a,little,while,,since,I'm,pretty,close,to,making,bitcoind,build,w/o,wxBase.,(it'll,be,in,init.cpp)

Sorry,about,my,choice,of,the,filename,"main.cpp",,another,possible,name,would,have,been,"core.cpp".,It's,much,too,late,to,change.,I,still,prefer,main.cpp.

We're,still,in,great,need,of,sample,code,showing,the,recommended,way,to,use,the,JSON-RPC,functions,,like,for,a,basic,account,system,on,a,typical,storefront,website.,Using,getreceivedbylabel,using,the,username,as,the,label,,changing,to,a,new,bitcoin,address,once,the,stored,one,for,that,account,gets,used.,I,posted,a,sample,code,fragment,on,the,forum,somewhere.,(search,on,getreceivedbylabel,or,getnewaddress),The,sample,code,could,be,a,plain,vanilla,bank,site,where,you,can,deposit,and,send,payments

Good,point.,If,you're,going,to,have,more,than,8,LAN,nodes,connect,to,one,gateway,node,,then,you'd,better,have,the,gateway,node,set,up,so,it,can,receive,incoming,connections.,Otherwise,,while,the,gateway,node,has,8,or,more,connections,,it,will,not,try,to,add,any,more,outbound,connections.,As,the,outside,nodes,you're,connected,to,come,and,go,,it,doesn't,make,new,outbound,connections,to,replace,them.,You'll,be,fine,if,you,can,accept,incoming,connections,,then,there,will,be,plenty,of,others,connecting,to,you.

Yes,,about,20,hours.,(120,conf,/,6,blocks,per,hour,=,20,hours),That's,the,normal,length,of,time,before,you,can,spend,it.,You,know,long,before,that,that,you,won,one.

I've,been,trying,to,encourage,someone,to,write,and,release,some,sample,Python,code,showing,the,recommended,way,to,do,the,typical,accounting,stuff,,but,to,no,avail.,It,would,be,nice,if,you,didn't,have,to,re-invent,the,wheel,like,you're,doing,here.,Search,on,getnewaddress,and,you,should,find,a,thread,where,I,gave,a,small,fragment,of,sample,pseudocode.

Right,,the,difficulty,adjustment,is,trying,to,keep,it,so,the,network,as,a,whole,generates,an,average,of,6,blocks,per,hour.,The,time,for,your,block,to,mature,will,always,be,around,20,hours.

The,recent,adjustment,put,us,back,to,close,to,6,blocks,per,hour,again.

There's,a,site,where,you,can,see,the,time,between,blocks,,and,since,block,68545,,it's,been,more,like,10,minutes,per,block:

We,need,someone,to,write,sample,code,,preferably,Python,or,Java,,showing,the,recommended,way,to,use,the,JSON-RPC,interface,to,create,an,account,system.,Most,sites,that,sell,things,will,need,something,like,this.,Someone,who's,kept,up,on,the,JSON-RPC,threads,here,should,have,some,idea,how,it,should,work.

When,a,user,is,logged,in,to,their,account,,you,show,the,bitcoin,address,they,can,send,to,to,add,funds.,Before,showing,it,,you,check,if,it's,been,used,,if,it,has,then,you,replace,it,with,a,new,one,(getnewaddress,<username>).,You,only,need,to,keep,the,latest,bitcoin,address,for,the,account,in,your,database.,(I,posted,a,sample,code,fragment,for,this,in,an,earlier,thread,somewhere,,search,on,getnewaddress)

You,use,getreceivedbylabel,<username>,with,the,username,as,the,label,to,get,the,"credit",amount,of,the,account.,You,need,to,keep,a,"debit",amount,in,your,database.,The,current,balance,of,the,account,is,(credit,-,debit).,When,the,user,spends,money,,you,increase,debit.

If,you're,requiring,more,than,0,confirmations,,it's,nice,if,you,show,the,current,balance,(0,confirmations),and,the,available,balance,(1,or,more,confirmations),,so,they,can,immediately,see,that,their,payment,is,acknowledged.,Not,all,sites,need,to,wait,for,confirmations,,so,the,dual,current,&,available,should,be,optional.,Most,sites,selling,digital,goods,are,fine,to,accept,0,confirmations.

A,nice,sample,app,for,this,would,be,a,simple,bank,site,,which,would,have,the,above,,plus,the,option,to,send,a,payment,to,a,bitcoin,address.,The,sample,code,should,be,the,simplest,possible,with,the,minimum,extra,stuff,to,make,it,a,working,site.

vekja.net,is,an,example,of,a,site,like,this.

We,should,queue,up,a,supply,of,pre-made,addresses,in,the,wallet,to,use,when,a,new,address,is,needed.,They,aren't,very,big,,so,it,wouldn't,hurt,to,have,a,lot,of,them.,This,would,more,generally,cover,the,case,also,where,someone,backs,up,,then,requests,a,new,address,and,receives,a,big,payment,with,it.,Maybe,there,should,be,separate,queues,so,one,type,of,demand,on,addresses,doesn't,deplete,it,for,the,others.

The,addresses,would,be,created,and,stored,in,the,normal,place,,but,also,listed,on,a,separate,list,of,created-but-never-used,addresses.,When,an,address,is,requested,,the,address,at,the,front,of,the,never-used,queue,is,handed,out,,and,a,new,address,is,created,and,added,to,the,back.

There's,some,kind,of,rescan,in,the,block,loading,code,that,was,made,to,repair,the,case,where,someone,copied,their,wallet.dat.,I,would,need,to,check,that,the,rescan,handles,the,case,of,rediscovering,received,payments,in,blocks,that,were,already,received,,but,are,forgotten,because,the,wallet,was,restored.

0.3.2,has,some,security,safeguards,to,lock,in,the,block,chain,up,to,this,point,and,limit,the,damage,a,little,if,someone,gets,50%.

But,if,someone,has,50%+,of,the,CPU,power,and,malicious,intent,,they,can,prove,what,it,already,says,in,the,design,document.

The,security,safeguard,makes,it,so,even,if,someone,does,have,more,than,50%,of,the,network's,CPU,power,,they,can't,try,to,go,back,and,redo,the,block,chain,before,yesterday.,(if,you,have,this,update)

I'll,probably,put,a,checkpoint,in,each,version,from,now,on.,Once,the,software,has,settled,what,the,widely,accepted,block,chain,is,,there's,no,point,in,leaving,open,the,unwanted,non-zero,possibility,of,revision,months,later.

I,believe,it'll,be,possible,for,a,payment,processing,company,to,provide,as,a,service,the,rapid,distribution,of,transactions,with,good-enough,checking,in,something,like,10,seconds,or,less.

The,network,nodes,only,accept,the,first,version,of,a,transaction,they,receive,to,incorporate,into,the,block,they're,trying,to,generate.,When,you,broadcast,a,transaction,,if,someone,else,broadcasts,a,double-spend,at,the,same,time,,it's,a,race,to,propagate,to,the,most,nodes,first.,If,one,has,a,slight,head,start,,it'll,geometrically,spread,through,the,network,faster,and,get,most,of,the,nodes.

The,payment,processor,has,connections,with,many,nodes.,When,it,gets,a,transaction,,it,blasts,it,out,,and,at,the,same,time,monitors,the,network,for,double-spends.,If,it,receives,a,double-spend,on,any,of,its,many,listening,nodes,,then,it,alerts,that,the,transaction,is,bad.,A,double-spent,transaction,wouldn't,get,very,far,without,one,of,the,listeners,hearing,it.,The,double-spender,would,have,to,wait,until,the,listening,phase,is,over,,but,by,then,,the,payment,processor's,broadcast,has,reached,most,nodes,,or,is,so,far,ahead,in,propagating,that,the,double-spender,has,no,hope,of,grabbing,a,significant,percentage,of,the,remaining,nodes.

No,,the,vending,machine,talks,to,a,big,service,provider,(aka,payment,processor),that,provides,this,service,to,many,merchants.,Think,something,like,a,credit,card,processor,with,a,new,job.,They,would,have,many,well,connected,network,nodes.

They're,only,intended,for,intrepid,programmers,who,read,the,sourcecode.

Now,I'm,hearing,a,report,that,it,IS,possible,for,javascript,to,do,a,cross-domain,POST,request,to,127.0.0.1.,Not,other,domains,,but,just,specifically,to,that,one.,Great...

If,this,is,the,case,,then,do,not,use,the,-server,switch,or,bitcoind,on,a,system,where,you,do,web,browsing.

I'll,get,started,on,adding,the,password,field.

The,change,list,is,basically,encompassed,by,what's,listed,in,the,first,message.,Everyone,should,upgrade,to,get,the,important,security,improvements.

Minimizing,to,tray,had,at,least,3,different,glitches,and,bugs,on,Linux,,including,a,crash,one,,so,I,disabled,it,again.,You,can,still,re-enable,the,option,with,"-minimizetotray",if,you,want,to,use,it,anyway.,The,bugs/glitches,are,somewhere,in,wxWidgets,or,GTK,or,Gnome,and,I,don't,know,how,to,fix,them.,Sorry,,I,just,don't,know,what,else,to,do,,it's,just,too,glitchy,and,buggy,to,have,as,a,mainline,feature.

OpenSSL,doesn't,have,any,interface,for,doing,just,the,low,level,raw,block,hash,part,of,SHA256.,SHA256,begins,by,wrapping,your,data,in,a,specially,formatted,buffer.,Setting,up,the,buffer,takes,an,order,of,magnitude,longer,than,the,actual,hashing,if,you're,only,hashing,one,or,two,blocks,like,we,do.,It's,intended,that,the,time,is,amortised,if,you,were,hashing,many,KB,or,MB,of,data.,In,BitcoinMiner,,we,format,the,buffer,once,and,keep,reusing,it.

If,you,can,find,SHA256,code,that's,faster,(with,MinGW/GCC),than,what,we've,got,,that,would,be,really,great!,(although,,keep,licensing,in,mind),The,one,we,have,is,the,only,one,I,tried,,so,there's,significant,chance,for,improvement.

When,I,wrote,it,more,than,2,years,ago,,there,were,screaming,hot,SHA1,implementations,but,minimal,attention,to,SHA256.,That's,a,lot,of,time,for,them,to,come,up,with,better,stuff.,SHA256,was,a,lot,slower,than,the,fastest,SHA1,at,the,time,than,I,thought,it,should,be.,Obviously,SHA256,should,be,slower,than,SHA1,by,a,certain,amount,,but,not,by,as,much,as,I,saw.

(hope,you,don't,mind,I,renamed,your,thread,,SHA-256,optimisation,is,something,important,that,I,keep,forgetting,about)

The,timing,is,strange,,just,as,we,are,getting,a,rapid,increase,in,3rd,party,coverage,after,getting,slashdotted.,I,hope,there's,not,a,big,hurry,to,wrap,the,discussion,and,decide.,How,long,does,Wikipedia,typically,leave,a,question,like,that,open,for,comment?

It,would,help,to,condense,the,article,and,make,it,less,promotional,sounding,as,soon,as,possible.,Just,letting,people,know,what,it,is,,where,it,fits,into,the,electronic,money,space,,not,trying,to,convince,them,that,it's,good.,They,probably,want,something,that,just,generally,identifies,what,it,is,,not,tries,to,explain,all,about,how,it,works.

If,you,post,in,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bitcoin,please,don't,say,"yeah,,but,bitcoin,is,really,important,and,special,so,the,rules,shouldn't,apply",or,argue,that,the,rule,is,dumb,or,unfair.,That,only,makes,it,worse.,Try,to,address,how,the,rule,is,satisfied.

Search,"bitcoin",on,google,and,see,if,you,can,find,more,big,references,in,addition,to,the,infoworld,and,slashdot,ones.,There,may,be,very,recent,stuff,being,written,by,reporters,who,heard,about,it,from,the,slashdot,article.

I,hope,it,doesn't,get,deleted.,If,it,does,,it'll,be,hard,to,overcome,the,presumption.,Institutional,momentum,is,to,stick,with,the,last,decision.,(edit:,or,at,least,I,assume,so,,that's,how,the,world,usually,works,,but,maybe,Wiki,is,different)

Still,need,to,know,what's,the,most,typical,settings,file,format,on,Linux.,Is,there,a,standard,file,extension?,I've,never,seen,a,settings,file,using,JSON,,and,it,doesn't,look,very,human,friendly,with,everything,required,to,be,in,quotes.,I,think,what,I,usually,see,is,like:
#,comment
setting=value

Is,there,a,settings,file,thing,in,Boost?

When,you're,using,bitcoind,to,issue,commands,from,the,command,line,as,a,client,,can,we,have,it,get,the,password,from,the,settings,file,then,too?

Gavin,pointed,out,I,forgot,to,increment,the,column,of,numbers,in,CommandLineRPC,,so,the,current,-rpcpw=,implementation,doesn't,work,right,from,the,command,line,with,non-string,parameters.,(JSON-RPC,is,fine),Still,under,construction.

By,making,some,adjustments,to,the,database,settings,,I,was,able,to,make,the,initial,block,download,about,5,times,faster.,It,downloads,in,about,30,minutes.

The,database,default,had,it,writing,each,block,to,disk,synchronously,,which,is,not,necessary.,I,changed,the,settings,to,let,it,cache,the,changes,in,memory,and,write,them,out,in,a,batch.,Blocks,are,still,written,transactionally,,so,either,the,complete,change,occurs,or,none,of,it,does,,in,either,case,the,data,is,left,in,a,valid,state.

I,only,enabled,this,change,during,the,initial,block,download.,When,you,come,within,2000,blocks,of,the,latest,block,,these,changes,turn,off,and,it,slows,down,to,the,old,way.

I,built,a,test,build,if,you'd,like,to,start,using,it:

http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-win32.zip
http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-linux.tar.gz

These,binaries,also,include,Gavin,Andresen's,JSON-RPC,HTTP,authentication,feature,and,the,other,important,security,improvements,from,0.3.2.

I've,been,running,a,test,over,the,last,24,hours,that,kills,and,restarts,it,randomly,every,2-60,seconds,(poor,thing),while,it's,trying,to,do,an,initial,block,download,and,it's,been,fine.

There,are,no,changes,to,the,way,it,handles,wallet.dat.,This,change,is,only,for,blk*.dat,and,the,non-critical,addr.dat.,You,can,always,delete,blk*.dat,if,it,gets,screwed,up,and,let,it,re-download.

FLATDATA,was,a,workaround,to,serialize,a,fixed,field,length,array.,There,was,a,cleaner,way,to,make,it,understand,how,to,serialize,arrays,directly,,but,MSVC6,couldn't,do,it,and,I,wanted,to,keep,compatibility,with,MSVC6,at,that,time.,We,don't,support,MSVC6,anymore,because,we,use,something,in,Boost,that,doesn't.,We,lost,support,for,it,after,0.2.0.,Maybe,someday,I'll,swap,in,the,clean,way,that,just,knows,how,to,serialize,fixed,length,arrays,without,wrapping,them,in,FLATDATA.

Please,do,these,tests,on,the,test,network.,That's,what,it's,for.,Thanks.

Red,,thanks,for,telling,me,privately,first!,Please,go,ahead,and,post,it,(and,relieve,the,suspense,for,everyone!)

His,point,is,that,transactions,paid,to,a,Bitcoin,Address,are,only,as,secure,as,the,hash,function.,To,make,Bitcoin,Addresses,short,,they,are,a,hash,of,the,public,key,,not,the,public,key,itself.,An,attacker,would,only,have,to,break,the,hash,function,,not,ECDSA

You,would,still,have,to,sign,it,with,public,key,654321.,You,need,to,find,a,collision,using,a,public,key,for,which,you,know,the,private,key.

When,you,claim,a,Bitcoin,Address,transaction,,you,give,your,public,key,that,matches,the,hash,,then,you,must,sign,it,with,that,key.

Red's,point,is,that,it's,easy,to,quickly,generate,insecure,public,keys,which,you,could,break,and,find,the,private,key,after,you,find,a,collision.

He,points,out,that,if,the,public,key,was,required,to,be,a,secure,one,,one,which,must,have,required,significant,work,to,find,the,prime,numbers,,that,would,increase,the,strength,above,that,of,the,hash,function,alone.,Someone,trying,to,brute,force,would,have,to,take,time,generating,a,key,for,each,attempt.

Correct,me,if,I'm,wrong,(please,,and,I'll,gladly,eat,crow),but,I,think,it,would,be,hard,to,use,an,analytical,attack,on,RIPEMD-160,in,this,case.,An,analytical,attack,prescribes,a,certain,range,or,pattern,of,inputs,to,try,that,will,greatly,increase,your,chance,of,finding,a,collision.,Here,,you,don't,have,that,kind,of,control,over,RIPEMD-160's,input,,because,the,input,is,the,output,of,SHA-256.,If,an,analytical,attack,helps,you,find,an,input,to,RIPEMD-160,that,produces,a,collision,,what,are,you,going,to,do,with,it?,You,still,have,to,get,SHA-256,to,output,that,value,,so,you,would,still,have,to,break,SHA-256,too.

For,brute,force,,RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)),is,no,stronger,than,RIPEMD-160,alone.,But,for,analytical,attack,,it,seems,like,you,must,analytical,attack,both,RIPEMD-160,and,SHA-256.,If,I'm,wrong,,then,the,strength,is,the,same,as,RIPEMD-160,and,the,SHA-256,only,serves,as,one,round,of,key,strengthening.

That's,strange,,didn't,someone,just,say,that,was,supposed,to,work?,(what,library,was,he,using?),Post,if,you,figure,out,what,wrong.

I,hope,it's,not,going,to,put,up,this,much,of,a,fight,for,all,PHP,users.

Looks,like,we've,got,the,Fortran,scenario,already.

For,future,reference,,here's,my,public,key.,It's,the,same,one,that's,been,there,since,the,bitcoin.org,site,first,went,up,in,2008.,Grab,it,now,in,case,you,need,it,later.

I,added,a,subset,of,the,Crypto++,5.6.0,library,to,the,SVN.,I,stripped,it,down,to,just,SHA,and,11,general,dependency,files.,There,shouldn't,be,any,other,crypto,in,there,other,than,SHA.

I,aligned,the,data,fields,and,it,worked.,The,ASM,SHA-256,is,about,48%,faster.,The,combined,speedup,is,about,2.5x,faster,than,version,0.3.3.

I,guess,it's,using,SSE2.,It,automatically,sets,its,build,configuration,at,compile,time,based,on,the,compiler,environment.

It,looks,like,it,has,some,SSE2,detection,at,runtime,,but,it's,hard,to,tell,if,it,actually,uses,it,to,fall,back,if,it's,not,available.,I,want,the,release,builds,to,have,SSE2.,SSE2,has,been,around,since,the,first,Pentium,4.,A,Pentium,3,or,older,would,be,so,slow,,you'd,be,wasting,your,electricity,trying,to,generate,on,it,anyway.

This,is,SVN,rev,114.

OK,,thanks.,I'd,also,like,to,know,if,it,runs,fine,as,long,as,you,don't,turn,on,Generate.,You'd,think,as,long,as,it,doesn't,actually,execute,any,SSE2,instructions,,it,would,still,load.,At,least,Pentium,3's,could,run,it,without,generating.


The,timestamp,is,limited,to,up,to,2,hours,in,the,future.,It,can,be,earlier,than,the,previous,block,,but,it,must,be,greater,than,the,median,of,the,last,11,blocks.,The,reason,for,doing,it,that,way,is,so,the,time,can,get,corrected,in,the,next,block,if,the,previous,block,had,the,time,too,far,in,the,future,,like,what,happened.


Unfortunately,I,upgraded,to,Ubuntu,10.04,before,0.3.0.,I,will,not,upgrade,anymore.,I,don't,know,when,I,might,have,time,to,reinstall,to,downgrade,,but,at,least,by,not,upgrading,,it'll,gradually,fix,itself.

Actually,,it,works,well,to,just,PM,me.,I'm,the,one,who's,going,to,be,fixing,it.,If,you,find,a,security,flaw,,I,would,definitely,like,to,hear,from,you,privately,to,fix,it,before,it,goes,public.

If,the,transaction,didn't,go,out,immediately,at,first,,like,if,you,weren't,connected,at,the,time,,it,may,take,up,to,2,hours,to,resend,it.,Long,term,,it,does,keep,relentlessly,sending,it.

I'll,shorten,that,length,of,time,in,a,future,version.

You,do,need,to,have,downloaded,the,complete,block,chain,(currently,71040,blocks),before,you'll,see,any,confirms.,Same,with,the,recipient.

The,reason,I,didn't,implement,listtransactions,is,I,want,to,make,sure,web,programmers,don't,use,it.,It,would,be,very,easy,to,latch,onto,that,for,watching,for,received,payments.,There,is,no,reliable,way,to,do,it,that,way,and,make,sure,nothing,can,slip,through,the,cracks.,Until,we,have,solid,example,code,using,getreceivedbyaddress,and,getreceivedbylabel,to,point,to,and,say,"use,this!,use,this!,don't,use,listtransactions!",,I,don't,think,we,should,implement,listtransactions.

When,we,do,implement,listtransactions,,maybe,one,way,to,fight,that,is,to,make,it,all,text.,It,should,not,break,down,the,fields,into,e.g.,comment,,confirmations,,credit,,debit.,It,could,be,one,pretty,formatted,string,like,"0/unconfirmed,,0:0:0,date,,comment,,,debit,4,credit,0",or,something,so,it's,hard,for,programmers,to,do,the,wrong,thing,and,process,it.,It's,only,for,viewing,the,status,of,your,server.,I,guess,that,would,be,kinda,annoying,for,web,interfaces,that,would,rather,format,it,into,html,columns,though.

"Minimize,to,the,tray,instead,of,the,taskbar",&,"Minimize,to,the,tray,on,close",must,not,be,implemented,yet,on,the,Mac.,We,should,grey,them,out,in,the,next,version.

The,reason,I,didn't,use,protocol,buffers,or,boost,serialization,is,because,they,looked,too,complex,to,make,absolutely,airtight,and,secure.,Their,code,is,too,large,to,read,and,be,sure,that,there's,no,way,to,form,an,input,that,would,do,something,unexpected.

I,hate,reinventing,the,wheel,and,only,resorted,to,writing,my,own,serialization,routines,reluctantly.,The,serialization,format,we,have,is,as,dead,simple,and,flat,as,possible.,There,is,no,extra,freedom,in,the,way,the,input,stream,is,formed.,At,each,point,,the,next,field,in,the,data,structure,is,expected.,The,only,choices,given,are,those,that,the,receiver,is,expecting.,There,is,versioning,so,upgrades,are,possible.

CAddress,is,about,the,only,object,with,significant,reserved,space,in,it.,(about,7,bytes,for,flags,and,12,bytes,for,possible,future,IPv6,expansion)

The,larger,things,we,have,like,blocks,and,transactions,can't,be,optimized,much,more,for,size.,The,bulk,of,their,data,is,hashes,and,keys,and,signatures,,which,are,uncompressible.,The,serialization,overhead,is,very,small,,usually,1,byte,for,size,fields.

On,Gavin's,idea,about,an,existing,P2P,broadcast,infrastructure,,I,doubt,one,exists.,There,are,few,P2P,systems,that,only,need,broadcast.,There,are,some,libraries,like,Chord,that,try,to,provide,a,distributed,hash,table,infrastructure,,but,that's,a,huge,difficult,problem,that,we,don't,need,or,want.,Those,libraries,are,also,much,harder,to,install,than,ourselves.

I,guess,we,should,try,to,support,the,case,where,there's,no,Content-Length,parameter.,I,don't,want,to,rip,and,replace,streams,though,,even,if,it,has,to,read,one,character,at,a,time.

Edit:,That,is,,assuming,there,actually,are,any,libraries,that,don't,support,Content-Length.

In,practice,,splits,are,likely,to,be,very,asymmetrical.,It,would,be,hard,to,split,the,world,down,the,middle.,More,likely,it,would,be,a,single,country,vs,the,rest,of,the,world,,lets,say,a,1:10,split.,In,that,case,,it,would,take,the,minority,fork,10,times,as,long,to,generate,100,blocks,,so,about,7,days.,Also,it,would,be,super,easy,for,the,client,to,realize,it's,hearing,way,too,few,blocks,and,something,must,be,wrong.

There's,no,time,limit.,Assuming,you,weren't,spending,coins,generated,in,the,minority,fork,,or,spending,someone's,double-spends,you,received,,your,transactions,can,get,into,the,other,chain,at,any,time,later.

The,new,safety,feature,displays,a,warning,message,in,the,status,bar,and,locks,down,RPC,if,it,detects,a,problem,that,may,require,an,upgrade.

If,it,sees,a,longer,chain,,but,it,can't,process,it,,then,it,knows,something,is,wrong.,It,displays,"WARNING:,Displayed,transactions,may,not,be,correct!,You,may,need,to,upgrade.",and,makes,most,RPC,commands,return,an,error.,It,still,keeps,generating,as,normal,,which,is,necessary,for,the,stability,of,the,network.

There,were,important,security,updates,in,the,versions,before,this,too,,so,if,you,haven't,upgraded,recently,,it's,extremely,important,that,you,upgrade,now!

Also,,don't,forget,,we,recently,added,2.4x,faster,generating,thanks,to,tcatm's,mid-state,caching,optimisation,and,BlackEye's,help,getting,ASM,SHA-256,working.

I'd,rather,you,didn't,make,a,build,of,the,1000,node,connecting,version,available.,It,won't,take,very,many,people,running,that,before,we,have,to,make,another,release,just,to,limit,the,incoming,connections.

I,guess,SourceForge,hasn't,updated,its,mirrors,yet.,The,files,are,there,on,the,admin,side,,but,not,on,the,user,side.,I,have,no,idea,how,long,that,will,take.,It's,always,been,immediate,in,the,past.

Edit:,SourceForge,is,updated,now.

The,software,is,designed,to,support,things,like,this.,I,was,going,to,post,details,of,the,plans,for,Escrow,,but,since,getting,slashdotted,I,haven't,had,time.

Bitcoin,isn't,currently,practical,for,very,small,micropayments.,Not,for,things,like,pay,per,search,or,per,page,view,without,an,aggregating,mechanism,,not,things,needing,to,pay,less,than,0.01.,The,dust,spam,limit,is,a,first,try,at,intentionally,trying,to,prevent,overly,small,micropayments,like,that.

Bitcoin,is,practical,for,smaller,transactions,than,are,practical,with,existing,payment,methods.,Small,enough,to,include,what,you,might,call,the,top,of,the,micropayment,range.,But,it,doesn't,claim,to,be,practical,for,arbitrarily,small,micropayments.

Forgot,to,add,the,good,part,about,micropayments.,While,I,don't,think,Bitcoin,is,practical,for,smaller,micropayments,right,now,,it,will,eventually,be,as,storage,and,bandwidth,costs,continue,to,fall.,If,Bitcoin,catches,on,on,a,big,scale,,it,may,already,be,the,case,by,that,time.,Another,way,they,can,become,more,practical,is,if,I,implement,client-only,mode,and,the,number,of,network,nodes,consolidates,into,a,smaller,number,of,professional,server,farms.,Whatever,size,micropayments,you,need,will,eventually,be,practical.,I,think,in,5,or,10,years,,the,bandwidth,and,storage,will,seem,trivial.

I,am,not,claiming,that,the,network,is,impervious,to,DoS,attack.,I,think,most,P2P,networks,can,be,DoS,attacked,in,numerous,ways.,(On,a,side,note,,I,read,that,the,record,companies,would,like,to,DoS,all,the,file,sharing,networks,,but,they,don't,want,to,break,the,anti-hacking/anti-abuse,laws.)

If,we,started,getting,DoS,attacked,with,loads,of,wasted,transactions,back,and,forth,,you,would,need,to,start,paying,a,0.01,minimum,transaction,fee.,0.1.5,actually,had,an,option,to,set,that,,but,I,took,it,out,to,reduce,confusion.,Free,transactions,are,nice,and,we,can,keep,it,that,way,if,people,don't,abuse,them.

That,brings,up,the,question:,if,there,was,a,minimum,0.01,fee,for,each,transaction,,should,we,automatically,add,the,fee,if,it's,just,the,minimum,0.01?,It,would,be,awfully,annoying,to,ask,each,time.,If,you,have,50.00,and,send,10.00,,the,recipient,would,get,10.00,and,you'd,have,39.99,left.,I,think,it,should,just,add,it,automatically.,It's,trivial,compared,to,the,fees,many,other,types,of,services,add,automatically.

One,alternative,is,to,use,a,round-up,system.,You,pay,for,,say,,1000,pages,or,images,or,downloads,or,searches,or,whatever,at,a,time.,When,you've,used,up,your,1000,pages,,you,pay,for,another,1000,pages.,If,you,only,use,1,page,,then,you,have,999,left,that,you,may,never,use,,but,it's,not,a,big,deal,because,the,cost,per,1000,is,still,small.

Or,you,could,pay,per,day.,The,first,time,you,access,the,site,on,a,given,day,,you,pay,for,24,hours,of,access.

Per,1000,or,per,day,may,be,easier,for,consumers,to,get,their,heads,around,too.,They,worry,about,per,item,because,it's,harder,to,figure,if,it,might,add,up,too,fast.,Unlimited,for,24,hours,they,know,what,the,cost,will,be.,Or,if,1000,seems,like,plenty,,they're,not,worrying,that,it's,costing,more,with,each,click,if,they,figure,1000,is,more,than,they'll,probably,use.

I,don't,know,a,way,to,implement,that.,The,transaction,fee,to,the,block,creator,uses,a,special,trick,to,include,the,transaction,fee,without,any,additional,size.,If,there,was,a,transaction,for,each,transaction,fee,,then,what,about,the,transactions,fees,for,the,transaction,fee's,transaction?

It's,not,implemented.

It,turned,out,nobody,liked,that,mode,of,transfer,anyway,,so,it,hasn't,had,much,development,attention.

I,can't,think,of,a,way,to,implement,that.,All,the,transaction,fees,would,be,additional,transactions.,What,about,the,transaction,fees,for,the,transaction,fee's,transaction?

If,you're,only,going,to,have,one,person,work,on,building,the,block,,that,could,take,days.,Oh,,do,you,mean,send,a,different,variation,to,each,node,with,the,tx,fee,written,to,them?

The,way,it,is,now,,it's,whoever,builds,this,gets,it.

If,we,needed,to,,we,could,have,a,BitTorrent-esque,tit-for-tat,for,transaction,broadcast.,Relay,paying,transactions,to,me,,or,I,won't,relay,them,to,you.,It,probably,won't,be,an,actual,problem,though.,It,only,takes,one,node,relaying,like,it,should,to,cancel,out,7,others,greedily,not,relaying.

A,transaction,can,be,written,that,requires,two,signatures,to,spend,it,next.,You,write,a,payment,that,requires,the,signature,of,both,the,recipient,and,the,sender,to,spend,it.,To,release,the,escrow,,you,give,the,recipient,the,signature,for,your,half,,or,the,payee,can,return,it,by,giving,you,his,signed,half.,There's,no,mediator,in,this,simple,case.,The,recourse,is,to,refuse,to,ever,release,it,,essentially,burning,the,money.

Once,you,get,away,from,a,system,where,each,node's,influence,is,proportional,to,their,CPU,power,,then,what,else,do,you,use,to,determine,who,is,(approximately),one,person?

It's,the,same,situation,as,gold,and,gold,mining.,The,marginal,cost,of,gold,mining,tends,to,stay,near,the,price,of,gold.,Gold,mining,is,a,waste,,but,that,waste,is,far,less,than,the,utility,of,having,gold,available,as,a,medium,of,exchange.

I,think,the,case,will,be,the,same,for,Bitcoin.,The,utility,of,the,exchanges,made,possible,by,Bitcoin,will,far,exceed,the,cost,of,electricity,used.,Therefore,,not,having,Bitcoin,would,be,the,net,waste.

Each,node's,influence,on,the,network,is,proportional,to,its,CPU,power.,The,only,way,to,show,the,network,how,much,CPU,power,you,have,is,to,actually,use,it.

If,there's,something,else,each,person,has,a,finite,amount,of,that,we,could,count,for,one-person-one-vote,,I,can't,think,of,it.,IP,addresses...,much,easier,to,get,lots,of,them,than,CPUs.

I,suppose,it,might,be,possible,to,measure,CPU,power,at,certain,times.,For,instance,,if,the,CPU,power,challenge,was,only,run,for,an,average,of,1,minute,every,10,minutes.,You,could,still,prove,your,total,power,at,given,times,without,running,it,all,the,time.,I'm,not,sure,how,that,could,be,implemented,though.,There's,no,way,for,a,node,that,wasn't,present,at,the,time,to,know,that,a,past,chain,was,actually,generated,in,a,duty,cycle,with,9,minute,breaks,,not,back,to,back.

Proof-of-work,has,the,nice,property,that,it,can,be,relayed,through,untrusted,middlemen.,We,don't,have,to,worry,about,a,chain,of,custody,of,communication.,It,doesn't,matter,who,tells,you,a,longest,chain,,the,proof-of-work,speaks,for,itself

Really?,Do,you,think,people,won't,be,able,to,understand,the,benefit?,(If,your,response,is,an,argument,that,there's,no,benefit,at,all,,I,guess,that,will,reinforce,the,case,that,people,won't,be,able,to,understand,it.)

Here's,an,outline,of,the,kind,of,escrow,transaction,that's,possible,in,software.,This,is,not,implemented,and,I,probably,won't,have,time,to,implement,it,soon,,but,just,to,let,you,know,what's,possible.

The,basic,escrow:,The,buyer,commits,a,payment,to,escrow.,The,seller,receives,a,transaction,with,the,money,in,escrow,,but,he,can't,spend,it,until,the,buyer,unlocks,it.,The,buyer,can,release,the,payment,at,any,time,after,that,,which,could,be,never.,This,does,not,allow,the,buyer,to,take,the,money,back,,but,it,does,give,him,the,option,to,burn,the,money,out,of,spite,by,never,releasing,it.,The,seller,has,the,option,to,release,the,money,back,to,the,buyer.

While,this,system,does,not,guarantee,the,parties,against,loss,,it,takes,the,profit,out,of,cheating.

If,the,seller,doesn't,send,the,goods,,he,doesn't,get,paid.,The,buyer,would,still,be,out,the,money,,but,at,least,the,seller,has,no,monetary,motivation,to,stiff,him.

The,buyer,can't,benefit,by,failing,to,pay.,He,can't,get,the,escrow,money,back.,He,can't,fail,to,pay,due,to,lack,of,funds.,The,seller,can,see,that,the,funds,are,committed,to,his,key,and,can't,be,sent,to,anyone,else.

Now,,an,economist,would,say,that,a,fraudulent,seller,could,start,negotiating,,such,as,"release,the,money,and,I'll,give,you,half,of,it,back",,but,at,that,point,,there,would,be,so,little,trust,and,so,much,spite,that,negotiation,is,unlikely.,Why,on,earth,would,the,fraudster,keep,his,word,and,send,you,half,if,he's,already,breaking,his,word,to,steal,it?,I,think,for,modest,amounts,,almost,everyone,would,refuse,on,principle,alone.

Sorry,about,that.,CRITICAL_BLOCK,isn't,perfect.,You,have,to,be,careful,not,to,break,or,continue,out,of,it.,There's,an,assert,that,catches,and,warns,about,break.,I,can,be,criticized,for,using,it,,but,the,syntax,would,be,so,much,more,bloated,and,error,prone,without,it.

Is,there,a,chance,the,SSE2,code,is,slow,on,Intel,because,of,some,quirk,that,could,be,worked,around?,For,instance,,if,something,works,but,is,slow,if,it's,not,aligned,,or,thrashing,the,cache,,or,one,type,of,instruction,that's,really,slow?,I'm,not,sure,how,available,it,is,,but,I,think,Intel,used,to,have,a,profiler,for,profiling,on,a,per,instruction,level.,I,guess,if,tcatm,doesn't,have,a,system,with,the,slow,processor,to,test,with,,there's,not,much,hope.,But,it,would,be,really,nice,if,this,was,working,on,most,CPUs.

The,heat,from,your,computer,is,not,wasted,if,you,need,to,heat,your,home.,If,you're,using,electric,heat,where,you,live,,then,your,computer's,heat,isn't,a,waste.,It's,equal,cost,if,you,generate,the,heat,with,your,computer.

If,you,have,other,cheaper,heating,than,electric,,then,the,waste,is,only,the,difference,in,cost.

If,it's,summer,and,you're,using,A/C,,then,it's,twice.

Bitcoin,generation,should,end,up,where,it's,cheapest.,Maybe,that,will,be,in,cold,climates,where,there's,electric,heat,,where,it,would,be,essentially,free.

This,is,a,very,interesting,topic.,If,a,solution,was,found,,a,much,better,,easier,,more,convenient,implementation,of,Bitcoin,would,be,possible.

Originally,,a,coin,can,be,just,a,chain,of,signatures.,With,a,timestamp,service,,the,old,ones,could,be,dropped,eventually,before,there's,too,much,backtrace,fan-out,,or,coins,could,be,kept,individually,or,in,denominations.,It's,the,need,to,check,for,the,absence,of,double-spends,that,requires,global,knowledge,of,all,transactions.

The,challenge,is,,how,do,you,prove,that,no,other,spends,exist?,It,seems,a,node,must,know,about,all,transactions,to,be,able,to,verify,that.,If,it,only,knows,the,hash,of,the,in/outpoints,,it,can't,check,the,signatures,to,see,if,an,outpoint,has,been,spent,before.,Do,you,have,any,ideas,on,this?

It's,hard,to,think,of,how,to,apply,zero-knowledge-proofs,in,this,case.

We're,trying,to,prove,the,absence,of,something,,which,seems,to,require,knowing,about,all,and,checking,that,the,something,isn't,included.

That,makes,it,sound,like,it,might,somehow,get,lost,and,the,parties,can't,get,it,even,if,they,want,to,cooperate.

When,you,pay,for,something,up,front,,you,can't,get,it,back,either.,Consumers,seem,comfortable,with,that.,It's,no,worse,than,that.

Either,party,always,has,the,option,to,release,it,to,the,other.

Then,you,must,also,be,against,the,common,system,of,payment,up,front,,where,the,customer,loses.

Payment,up,front:,customer,loses,,and,the,thief,gets,the,money.
Simple,escrow:,customer,loses,,but,the,thief,doesn't,get,the,money,either.

Are,you,guys,saying,payment,up,front,is,better,,because,at,least,the,thief,gets,the,money,,so,at,least,someone,gets,it?

Imagine,someone,stole,something,from,you.,You,can't,get,it,back,,but,if,you,could,,if,it,had,a,kill,switch,that,could,be,remote,triggered,,would,you,do,it?,Would,it,be,a,good,thing,for,thieves,to,know,that,everything,you,own,has,a,kill,switch,and,if,they,steal,it,,it'll,be,useless,to,them,,although,you,still,lose,it,too?,If,they,give,it,back,,you,can,re-activate,it.

Imagine,if,gold,turned,to,lead,when,stolen.,If,the,thief,gives,it,back,,it,turns,to,gold,again.

It,still,seems,to,me,the,problem,may,be,one,of,presenting,it,the,right,way.,For,one,thing,,not,being,so,blunt,about,"money,burning",for,the,purposes,of,game,theory,discussion.,The,money,is,never,truly,burned.,You,have,the,option,to,release,it,at,any,time,forever.

Still,thinking,this,idea,through...

The,only,job,the,network,needs,to,do,is,to,tell,whether,a,spend,of,an,outpoint,is,the,first,or,not.

If,we're,willing,to,have,clients,keep,the,history,for,their,own,money,,then,some,of,the,information,may,not,need,to,be,stored,by,the,network,,such,as:
-,the,value
-,the,association,of,inpoints,and,outpoints,in,one,transaction

The,network,would,track,a,bunch,of,independent,outpoints.,It,doesn't,know,what,transactions,or,amounts,they,belong,to.,A,client,can,find,out,if,an,outpoint,has,been,spent,,and,it,can,submit,a,satisfying,inpoint,to,mark,it,spent.,The,network,keeps,the,outpoint,and,the,first,valid,inpoint,that,proves,it,spent.,The,inpoint,signs,a,hash,of,its,associated,next,outpoint,and,a,salt,,so,it,can,privately,be,shown,that,the,signature,signs,a,particular,next,outpoint,if,you,know,the,salt,,but,publicly,the,network,doesn't,know,what,the,next,outpoint,is.

I,believe,the,clients,would,have,to,keep,the,entire,history,back,to,the,original,generated,coins.,Someone,sending,a,payment,would,have,to,send,data,to,the,recipient,,as,well,as,still,communicating,with,the,network,to,mark,outpoints,spent,and,check,that,the,spend,is,the,first,spend.,Maybe,the,data,transfer,could,be,done,as,an,e-mail,attachment.

The,fact,that,clients,have,to,keep,the,entire,history,reduces,the,privacy,benefit.,Someone,handling,a,lot,of,money,still,gets,to,see,a,lot,of,transaction,history.,The,way,it,retrospectively,fans,out,,they,might,end,up,seeing,a,majority,of,the,history.,Denominations,could,be,made,granular,to,limit,fan-out,,but,a,business,handling,a,lot,of,money,might,still,end,up,seeing,a,lot,of,the,history.

No,,it,doesn't,usually,empty,your,wallet,with,each,transaction.,It,uses,the,smallest,set,of,coins,it,can,find,to,add,up,to,near,the,amount.,In,this,case,,unfortunately,,his,wallet,had,a,single,9000,BTC,bill,in,it,,and,it,had,to,break,it,to,get,1,BTC,and,8999,BTC,change.

It,doesn't,have,to,be,such,a,breaking,change.,New,nodes,could,accept,old,transactions,for,a,long,time,until,most,nodes,have,already,upgraded,before,starting,to,refuse,transactions,without,PoW.,Or,,they,could,always,accept,old,transactions,,but,only,a,limited,number,per,time,period.

I've,thought,about,PoW,on,transactions,many,times,,but,usually,I,end,up,thinking,a,0.01,transaction,fee,is,essentially,similar,and,better.,0.01,is,basically,a,proof,of,work,,but,not,wasted.,But,if,the,problem,is,validating,loads,of,transactions,,then,PoW,could,be,checked,faster.

A,more,general,umbrella,partial,solution,would,be,to,implement,the,idea,where,an,unlikely,dropoff,in,blocks,received,is,detected.,Then,an,attacker,would,still,need,a,substantial,portion,of,the,network's,power,to,benefit,from,a,DoS,attack.

t,would,be,nice,to,keep,the,blk*.dat,files,small,as,long,as,we,can.

The,eventual,solution,will,be,to,not,care,how,big,it,gets.

But,for,now,,while,it's,still,small,,it's,nice,to,keep,it,small,so,new,users,can,get,going,faster.,When,I,eventually,implement,client-only,mode,,that,won't,matter,much,anymore.

There's,more,work,to,do,on,transaction,fees.,In,the,event,of,a,flood,,you,would,still,be,able,to,jump,the,queue,and,get,your,transactions,into,the,next,block,by,paying,a,0.01,transaction,fee.,However,,I,haven't,had,time,yet,to,add,that,option,to,the,UI.

Scale,or,not,,the,test,network,will,react,in,the,same,ways,,but,with,much,less,wasted,bandwidth,and,annoyance.

Are,you,back,to,talking,about,the,existing,Bitcoin,system,here?

I,was,talking,about,in,the,hypothetical,system,I,was,describing,,if,the,network,doesn't,know,the,values,and,lineage,of,the,transactions,,then,it,can't,verify,them,and,vouch,for,them,,so,the,clients,would,have,to,keep,the,history,all,the,way,back.

If,a,client,wasn't,present,until,recently,,the,two,ways,to,convince,it,that,a,transaction,has,a,valid,past,is:
1),Show,it,the,entire,history,back,to,the,original,generated,coin.
2),Show,it,a,history,back,to,a,thoroughly,deep,block,,then,trust,that,if,so,many,nodes,all,said,the,history,up,to,then,was,correct,then,it,must,be,true.

But,if,the,network,didn't,know,all,the,values,and,lineage,of,the,transactions,,it,couldn't,do,2),,I,don't,think.

True,,there,would,probably,be,someone,with,a,dial-up,modem,or,satellite,dish,internet.,Rarer,would,be,someone,who,has,both,that,and,the,wired,internet,that,has,the,outage,,but,if,it's,a,big,enough,segment,to,matter,,out,of,a,million,people,there's,bound,to,be,a,multi-home,geek.

ISP,network,cuts,are,just,your,local,area.,If,you,still,have,communication,with,the,rest,of,your,area,,it,would,probably,be,something,like,1/1000,of,the,world,or,less.,Block,generation,in,the,segment,would,take,several,hours,per,block.

I,favour,the,plan,to,monitor,if,the,frequency,of,blocks,received,drops,too,slow.,That,covers,a,large,range,of,possibilities.

I'm,not,grasping,your,idea,yet.,Does,it,hide,any,information,from,the,public,network?,What,is,the,advantage?

If,at,least,50%,of,nodes,validated,transactions,enough,that,old,transactions,can,be,discarded,,then,everyone,saw,everything,and,could,keep,a,record,of,it.

Can,public,nodes,see,the,values,of,transactions?,Can,they,see,which,previous,transaction,the,value,came,from?,If,they,can,,then,they,know,everything.,If,they,can't,,then,they,couldn't,verify,that,the,value,came,from,a,valid,source,,so,you,couldn't,take,their,generated,chain,as,verification,of,it.

Does,it,hide,the,bitcoin,addresses?,Is,that,it?,OK,,maybe,now,I,see,,if,that's,it.

Crypto,may,offer,a,way,to,do,"key,blinding".,I,did,some,research,and,it,was,obscure,,but,there,may,be,something,there.,"group,signatures",may,be,related.

There's,something,here,in,the,general,area:
http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/rh/

What,we,need,is,a,way,to,generate,additional,blinded,variations,of,a,public,key.,The,blinded,variations,would,have,the,same,properties,as,the,root,public,key,,such,that,the,private,key,could,generate,a,signature,for,any,one,of,them.,Others,could,not,tell,if,a,blinded,key,is,related,to,the,root,key,,or,other,blinded,keys,from,the,same,root,key.,These,are,the,properties,of,blinding.,Blinding,,in,a,nutshell,,is,x,=,(x,*,large_random_int),mod,m.

When,paying,to,a,bitcoin,address,,you,would,generate,a,new,blinded,key,for,each,use.

Then,you,need,to,be,able,to,sign,a,signature,such,that,you,can't,tell,that,two,signatures,came,from,the,same,private,key.,I'm,not,sure,if,always,signing,a,different,blinded,public,key,would,already,give,you,this,property.,If,not,,I,think,that's,where,group,signatures,comes,in.,With,group,signatures,,it,is,possible,for,something,to,be,signed,but,not,know,who,signed,it.

As,an,example,,say,some,unpopular,military,attack,has,to,be,ordered,,but,nobody,wants,to,go,down,in,history,as,the,one,who,ordered,it.,If,10,leaders,have,private,keys,,one,of,them,could,sign,the,order,and,you,wouldn't,know,who,did,it.

Some,places,where,generation,will,gravitate,to:
1),places,where,it's,cheapest,or,free
2),people,who,want,to,help,for,idealogical,reasons
3),people,who,want,to,get,some,coins,without,the,inconvenience,of,doing,a,transaction,to,buy,them

There,are,legitimate,places,where,it's,free.,Generation,is,basically,free,anywhere,that,has,electric,heat,,since,your,computer's,heat,is,offsetting,your,baseboard,electric,heating.,Many,small,flats,have,electric,heat,out,of,convenience.

How,expensive,is,heating,oil?,With,the,price,of,oil,so,high,,if,it's,actually,more,expensive,than,electric,,then,generating,would,have,negative,cost.

There's,also,kids,putting,it,on,their,parent's,power,bill,,employees,their,employer,,botnets,,etc.

Case,3,comes,into,play,for,small,amounts.,The,overhead,of,doing,an,exchange,doesn't,make,sense,if,you,just,need,a,small,bit,of,pocket,change,for,incidental,micropayments.,I,think,this,is,a,nice,advantage,vs,fiat,currency,,instead,of,all,the,seigniorage,going,to,one,big,entity,,let,it,go,in,convenience,amounts,to,people,who,need,to,scrape,up,a,small,amount,of,change.

Don't,update,the,block,chain,download.,When,you,take,someone's,block,chain,download,,you,don't,want,it,right,up,to,the,end.,A,somewhat,old,one,is,better,so,it,can,download,and,verify,the,most,recent,blocks.


Just,leave,the,old,one,alone!,Older,is,better.,What,block,number,is,it?,Anywhere,from,60000-74000,is,good.,The,one,that,you've,had,available,for,a,while,has,been,vetted,and,is,the,best,choice.

Agree,,wanted,to,do,that,for,a,long,time,,haven't,had,time,to,do,it.

For,now,,you,could,also,subscribe,to,the,bitcoin-list,mailing,list.,It,rarely,gets,used,except,for,announcements,like,this,and,major,new,versions.


I,suspect,there's,some,difficulty,receiving,blocks,if,all,the,nodes,you're,connected,to,are,0.3.9,or,lower.,We,need,enough,of,us,so,that,at,least,one,node,you,connect,to,will,be,0.3.10.,The,problem,will,start,to,go,away,when,we,make,up,more,than,1/8th,of,the,network.

It'll,help,if,you,port,forward,so,you,can,get,lots,of,connections.

Right,,it,will,get,reincorporated,into,the,fixed,chain.,The,transaction,won't,disappear,,it'll,still,be,visible,on,both,sides,,but,the,confirmation,count,will,jump,back,to,0,and,start,counting,up,again.

It's,only,if,you,generated,a,block,in,the,bad,chain,after,block,74638,that,the,50,BTC,from,that,will,disappear.,Any,blocks,in,the,bad,chain,wouldn't,have,matured,yet.

1),Once,more,than,50%,of,the,node,power,is,upgraded,and,the,good,chain,overtakes,the,bad,,the,0.3.10,nodes,will,make,it,hard,for,any,bad,transactions,to,get,any,confirmations.
2),If,you,didn't,remove,your,blk*.dat,files,,you're,not,helping,to,contribute,to,that,50%,,and,you'll,still,show,bad,transactions,until,the,good,chain,overtakes,the,bad,chain.

The,bad,chain,is,also,slowed,down,as,more,nodes,upgrade.

We've,already,generated,14,blocks,since,74638.,The,builds,of,0.3.10,were,uploaded,about,2,and,3,hours,ago.,Of,the,nodes,I'm,connected,to,,more,than,half,are,already,0.3.10.,I,would,say,we,probably,already,have,more,power,than,the,bad,chain.

That,works.

That's,strange...,are,we,sure,that's,the,same,thing?,tcatm,,try,amdfam10,and,make,sure,you,get,the,same,speed,measurement.

It,looks,like,we,overtook,the,bad,chain,somewhere,around,74689.,0.3.9,and,lower,nodes,have,been,responding,with,the,current,block,number,for,some,hours,now.

That,means,it's,no,longer,necessary,to,delete,blk*.dat,before,upgrading.,You,can,just,upgrade,and,it'll,reorg,away,the,bad,block,chain.

Thanks,to,everyone,for,the,quick,response!

That's,a,difficult,approach.

We,need,to,cause,a,reorg,,which,will,disconnect,the,invalid,chain.

This,is,code,that,will,rarely,ever,get,tested,,and,is,fairly,intricate,,so,something,simple,and,safe,is,best.

Here's,what,I,was,thinking,of.,(I,haven't,tested,this,yet),It,checks,all,the,blocks,in,the,main,chain.,If,it,finds,a,bad,one,,it,sets,all,that,chain's,bnChainWork,to,0,so,it,can't,win,best,chain,again,,and,it,reduces,best,chain,work,to,the,fork,level,so,any,new,block,after,the,fork,will,cause,a,reorg.,(It,can't,change,pindexBest,without,actually,doing,a,reorg)

This,isn't,perfect,yet.,It,still,needs,to,receive,one,valid,block,to,trigger,the,reorg.,

It,would,probably,be,possible,to,initiate,an,AddToBlockIndex,or,Reorganize,after,the,check,,but,it,would,require,a,lot,more,careful,attention.,I,probably,should,break,out,part,of,AddToBlockIndex,that,sets,the,new,best,block.,I'll,probably,end,up,doing,that,instead,of,the,code,below.

I'd,like,to,reduce,the,number,of,blocks,displayed,in,the,status,bar,by,1.,,When,you,first,load,the,program,,it'll,display,0,blocks,instead,of,1:
"0,connections,,0,blocks,,,0,transactions"

It's,always,been,"nBestHeight,+,1",because,it's,counting,the,genesis,block.,Technically,,yes,,the,genesis,block,is,a,block.,It's,a,hardcoded,block,that,you,start,out,with.,You,can't,not,have,the,genesis,block.,Maybe,think,of,it,as,a,reference,coin,that,you,measure,other,coins,against.,The,block,count,people,are,looking,for,is,the,number,of,blocks,they've,downloaded.

The,main,benefit,is,that,blocks,will,be,equal,to,the,block,number,of,the,current,best,block.,If,blocks,is,10,,then,the,highest,block,number,you,have,is,10.,It,means,you,have,block,10,and,you,don't,have,block,11.

It,would,reduce,the,confusion,we,had,here:

With,this,we,wouldn't,have,needed,to,delete,blk*.dat,,it,would,have,automatically,done,a,reorg,back,to,the,fork.,There,wasn't,time,to,do,a,careful,implementation,of,this,at,the,time.

It,might,take,longer,than,we,want,,since,it,has,to,load,all,the,blocks.,If,it's,too,slow,,we,could,have,it,only,go,back,to,a,certain,block,number

There,is,no,way,for,the,software,to,automatically,know,if,one,chain,is,better,than,another,except,by,the,greatest,proof-of-work.,In,the,design,it,was,necessary,for,it,to,switch,to,a,longer,chain,no,matter,how,far,back,it,has,to,go.

The,only,exception,to,that,is,the,manual,checkpoints,I've,added.,If,it,weren't,for,those,,it,would,be,able,to,reorg,all,the,way,back,to,the,first,block.

Un-upgraded,nodes,have,the,correct,chain,most,of,the,time,,but,they,are,still,trying,to,include,the,overflow,transaction,in,every,block,,so,they're,continually,trying,to,fork,and,generate,invalid,blocks.,If,an,old,version,node,is,restarted,,its,transaction,pool,is,emptied,,so,it,may,generate,valid,blocks,for,a,while,until,the,transaction,gets,broadcast,again.,0.3.9,and,lower,nodes,still,must,upgrade.

The,SVN,now,has,the,code,we,needed,to,automatically,reorg,the,block,chain,without,having,to,delete,the,blk*.dat,files,manually.,I,knew,I,couldn't,write,that,code,fast,and,carefully,enough,yesterday,,so,I,went,with,the,quick,manual,option.

Definitely.,The,old,screenshots,of,0.1,are,very,outdated.

Windows,Aero,is,a,good,choice.,Windows,is,still,the,largest,user,group.,Mind,what's,behind,it,for,the,transparent,parts.

What,to,have,displayed,in,the,transaction,list?,Not,completely,filled,up,with,stuff,,just,a,few,things.

The,performance,numbers,posted,from,a,VIA,C7's,hardware,SHA-256,weren't,astronomical.,Only,in,the,1500,khash/s,range.,If,you,think,about,it,,just,because,it's,implemented,in,hardware,doesn't,mean,it's,crazy,fast.,It,still,has,to,do,all,the,steps.,It's,only,if,simplifying,it,down,to,single-purpose,hardware,makes,it,small,enough,to,fit,many,in,parallel.,That's,not,necessarily,easy,or,a,given.

In,the,next,SVN,rev,,I'll,make,it,only,go,back,to,the,last,checkpoint,at,block,74000.,If,we,need,to,correct,a,problem,in,the,future,,we,can,always,make,sure,it,goes,back,at,least,as,far,back,as,the,problem.,Also,,I'm,adding,code,to,verify,the,block,index,,which,means,the,proof-of-work,chain,is,checked.

Still,,the,system,won't,be,entirely,secure,against,your,blk*.dat,files.,You,are,trusting,someone,if,you,use,a,copy,of,their,blk,files.

That's,a,really,well,written,walkthough.,Someone,should,confirm,if,they,followed,it,and,didn't,run,into,any,snags.

Make,sure,your,computer's,date,and,time,are,correct.

I'm,not,sure,what,to,call,it,,but,we,could,use,a,post,that,lists,these,things,users,should,know.,If,someone,has,time,to,write,it,,here's,the,list:

-,Make,sure,your,clock,is,set,correctly.

-,Microsoft,Security,Essentials.,This,never,got,written,up,proper.

-,Warning,not,to,mess,around,with,your,wallet.dat,file.,It's,a,database,file,,it's,not,as,simple,as,you,think.,In,this,Beta,version,,we,haven't,had,time,to,try,and,tinker-proof,it,yet.,It,may,not,work,as,expected,if,you,start,swapping,it,around.

That's,right.,You,don't,need,to,be,re-broadcasting,your,transactions,for,it,to,work.

When,any,node,disconnects,a,fork,,it,dumps,all,the,transactions,from,the,fork,back,into,the,transaction,pool,to,add,to,the,new,chain.,The,entire,network,is,making,sure,to,re-integrate,your,transactions,again.,All,you,should,see,is,that,your,number,of,confirmations,starts,over,from,0.

In,some,types,of,forks,,your,transaction,would,have,gotten,into,both,forks,already,,so,you're,already,good,either,way.

The,clock,part,will,be,covered,in,the,next,release,(0.3.11,or,higher).,SVN,rev,141,pops,up,a,message,box,if,your,clock,is,too,far,off.

The,margin,is,2,hours.

This,should,be,solved,in,SVN,rev,141,and,the,next,release,(0.3.11+).,It'll,pop,up,a,message,box,alerting,you,if,your,clock,is,off,by,more,than,an,hour.

This,probably,explains,why,hyperthreading,increases,performance,with,-4way.,If,three,SSE2,units,is,excessive,,then,hyperthreading,would,help,keep,them,all,busy.
If,you're,so,paranoid,that,you're,getting,hysterical,over,this,,then,surely,you're,paranoid,enough,that,if,a,warning,message,displays,on,the,status,bar,,you'll,check,the,website,and,forum.

I,think,if,another,bug,like,the,overflow,bug,occurs,,it's,important,that,automated,websites,stop,trading,until,their,admins,can,check,out,what's,going,on,and,decide,what,to,do.,If,you,decide,it's,a,false,alarm,and,want,to,take,your,chances,,you,can,use,the,"-disablesafemode",switch.


The,remaining,14,methods,function,as,normal.

I,believe,the,safer,option,should,be,enabled,by,default.,If,you,want,your,server,to,keep,trading,and,ignore,an,alert,saying,the,money,its,receiving,might,be,like,the,money,from,the,overflow,bug,,then,you,can,use,the,switch,and,not,blame,anyone,else,if,you,lose,your,money.

Worst,case,if,you,leave,alerts,enabled,,your,site,stops,trading,until,you,upgrade,or,add,the,-disablesafemode,switch.

Getting,surprised,by,some,temporary,down,time,when,your,node,would,otherwise,be,at,risk,is,better,than,getting,surprised,by,a,thief,draining,all,your,inventory.

Someday,when,we,haven't,found,any,new,bugs,for,a,long,time,and,it,has,been,thoroughly,security,reviewed,without,finding,anything,,this,can,be,scaled,back.,I'm,not,arguing,that,this,is,the,permanent,way,of,things,forever.,It's,still,beta,software.

Can,you,provide,more,details,about,what,removing,DB_PRIVATE,does?

I,can't,remember,if,I,had,a,specific,reason,for,DB_PRIVATE,,or,if,I,just,copied,the,flags,from,some,example,code.,Does,removing,DB_PRIVATE,make,it,safe,for,other,processes,to,open,the,database,simultaneously?,That,may,be,an,improvement,,depending,what,the,side,effects,are.,Does,it,substantially,reduce,performance,by,making,it,have,to,write,out,every,change,immediately,or,do,other,coordination?,Are,there,additional,locking,or,coordination,files,then?,What,else,changes?,You,could,test,by,timing,an,initial,block,download,with,and,without,DB_PRIVATE,,preferably,-connect-ing,to,a,local,machine,so,network,isn't,a,factor.

Apparently,,DB_PRIVATE,doesn't,do,what,you,would,hope,it,would,do,,which,is,prevent,other,processes,from,being,able,to,open,the,database.,It,still,lets,them,,it,just,screws,up,if,they,do.,Another,option,,if,there's,a,way,,would,be,to,make,it,lock,the,database,files,so,they,can't,be,accessed,by,other,processes.

I,started,posting,in,the,other,topic,but,I'll,repeat,here,,this,thread,seems,more,specific,to,the,topic.

The,main,backup,improvement,will,be,a,pre-generated,pool,of,keys,and,a,rescan,at,load,to,scrape,missed,transactions,from,the,block,history.,Then,a,backup,will,last,forward,for,a,long,time.

I,was,starting,to,post,the,same,idea,you,said,nelisky.

How,about,a,json-rpc,command,that,locks,the,wallet,,flushes,it,,copies,wallet.dat,to,a,location,you,specified,,then,unlocks,it?,That,would,be,a,smaller,project,than,the,pooled,keys,,so,maybe,it,could,be,done,first.

What's,the,simplest,portable,way,to,copy,a,file?,Is,there,something,in,Boost?

Sorry,,I've,been,so,busy,lately,I've,been,skimming,messages,and,I,still,can't,keep,up.

We,want,to,avoid,Windows,API,calls,whenever,possible.,They,usually,take,about,6-8,parameters,and,a,lot,of,testing,to,get,right,,it,takes,a,page,of,code,to,do,something,simple.

I,usually,shy,away,from,iostreams.,Seems,like,I,too,often,hit,limitations.,They,kind,of,botched,the,C++,streams,standard,in,the,90's,,which,is,too,bad,,streams,can,be,very,powerful,and,useful,when,done,right.,Using,it,in,rpc.cpp,may,still,turn,out,to,be,a,mistake.

Bottom,line,is,I'd,rather,call,an,existing,file,copy,function,than,make,and,test,my,own.

Bitcoins,have,no,dividend,or,potential,future,dividend,,therefore,not,like,a,stock.

More,like,a,collectible,or,commodity.
